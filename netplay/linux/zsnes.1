.SH "FILES AND DIRECTORIES"
.TP
zsnes
The main program
.TP
~/.zsnes
This is the directory where ZSNES configuration files are stored. By default, it is also the directory where save states, screenshots, SPC dumps and ZMV movie files are stored, but you can change this behaviour by editing zsnesl.cfg. This directory is created by ZSNES.
.TP
~/.zsnes/zsnesl.cfg
This file is where configuration settings for ZSNES are stored. It is in a human-readable format and can be edited by hand. It is created by ZSNES.
.TP
~/.zsnes/.zguicfgl.dat
This file is where settings for the GUI are saved. It is created by ZSNES.

.B If for some reason you update your version of ZSNES and it keeps crashing before you can do anything, you should try deleting the two above files and let ZSNES create new ones.


.SH "SPECIAL CHIP GAMES"
Many games on the Super Nintendo used custom CPUs in addition to the main SNES CPU. Some of these CPUs have not been fully reverse-engineered, and games that use them may either not work or may experience strange bugs.

You can find more information about many of these special CPUs at http://users.tpg.com.au/trauma/dsp/ and http://nsrt.edgeemu.com/INFO/chipinfo.htm .


.SH "GRAPHICS PACKS"
Some games based on the SPC7110 chip, such as Far East of Eden Zero, can use special graphics packs to work around unemulated portions of their custom CPU. These graphics packs must be stored in individual directories within the save directory, which is specified in zsnesl.cfg. By default, this is ~/.zsnes. The directory name of each graphics pack must be capitalized and all files within that directory must be in lowercase.

The proper directory name for a given graphics pack can be found in the readme file included with that pack.

NOTE: As of version 1.40, games which use the S-DD1 chip (Star Ocean, Street Fighter Alpha 2) do not require graphics packs.

.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
You can report bugs using the bug tracker at the ZSNES SourceForge page, located at http://sourceforge.net/projects/zsnes/.
