    Please read the 'BUGINFO.TXT' that came with your distrobution.

   Getting help with ZSNES
  =========================

    To get help with ZSNES you can visit the ZSNES message boards.
    Please, read the rules thoroughly before posting anything.

    There are also several mailing lists devoted to ZSNES which are
    kindly hosted by SourceForge.  They are usually low-traffic.

    http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=19677

    And last, but not least, there are several IRC channels which
    have been created for the sole purpose of worshiping ZSNES. :)

  =================
   #ZSNES on EFnet
  =================

    This is where it all of the old developers of ZSNES used to hangout
    (and probably where they met).  Some of the developers such as
    _Demo_, pagefault, and stainless, and tons of ZSNES fans hangout
    here.  Be warned that this channel is usually plagued with adult
    humor, links and requests for warez and ROMs, and always off-topic.

  ==================
   #ZSNES on DALnet
  ==================
    
    I recommend this one, since you probably won't encounter all of
    the illegal stuff and adult content (though, I'm sure not going
    to complain about it :P).  You probably won't find many of the
    ZSNES developers such as _Demo_ or pagefault in there, but then
    again you really don't need to be bugging them anyway.
