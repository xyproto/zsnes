Some Issues :

Windows Port:
- DirectSound in ZSNESw doesn't support the primary sound buffer.
  Unfortunately, this causes 8-bit quality sounds on certain computers.
- OpenGL, or Direct3D support would be nice
- Use another (free) compiler for the windows version (cygwin?)
- Auto-detect high/low latency connections and adjust settings accordingly

Compatibility
- Game not working - Guikuden 1 (and some more)
- Graphics Glitches - Uniracers (2p mode), Killer Instinct (couple stages,
    black background), FF3 (some sprite clipping probs), Metal Combat,
    Tactic Ogre (Menus?)
- Special Chips - DSP1 (60% done), DSP2 (0% done), SA-1 (95% done),
                  SDD-1 (decompression left), and others
