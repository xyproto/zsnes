Tue March 23 1999 Alexandre Parenteau  <aubonbeurre@geocities.com>
	* WinCvs 1.0.6 : a huge bug reported by Jeroen C. van Gelderen
	("case ssh : return ":ext"; break;" misses another colon) +
	a little enhancement of the tagging dialog.

Mon March 22 1999 HANAI Tohru <honey@din.or.jp>
	* WinCvs 1.0.6 : tab circulation between the panes.

Mon March 22 1999 Alex Lemaresquier <alex@brainstorm.fr>
	* WinCvs 1.0.6 : memory leak problem fixed.
	* WinCvs 1.0.6 : VC5 projects fixed.

Tue March 16 1999 HANAI Tohru <honey@din.or.jp>
	* WinCvs 1.0.5 : patches correcting :
	Bug fix
	1. Now WinCvs remembers it's size when window state is SW_NOWMAL.
	2. Doesn't show SplashScreen when WinCvs starts as iconic.
	3. When user double-clicks on an item of CBrowseFileView, now it
		executes associated executable correctly.
		(When an association value(on registry) was written as using 
		parameter, like "some.exe %1", WinCvs had executed the 
		default viewer.)
	To be having more friendly GUI
	1. Now CWinCvsBrowser shows selection with highlight, ALWAYS.
	2. CBrowseFileView had always shown one but it does with 
		different CWinCvsBrowser's color, so I have made it with 
		the same color.

Tue Feb 23 1999 Alex Lemaresquier <alex@brainstorm.fr>
	* WinCvs 1.0.4 : new patch correcting 2 details and 2
	severe problems. One of them is hopefully the memory leak.
	But there are still 2 remaining problems during the update
	of the TreeView/ListView.

Mon Feb 16 1999 Alexandre Parenteau  <aubonbeurre@geocities.com>
	* WinCvs 1.0.4 : Problem fixed regarding the log parser.
	Thanks Hartmut Keller <keller@FS-NET.DE>.

Mon Thu 11 1999 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* WinCvs 1.0.4 : Paul Henschke's patch <henschke@mincom.com>.
	Should fix both Win2000 & NT40 browser problem. Thanks Paul.
	* Integrated the patch below : thanks Blake Sobiloff
	<sobiloff@mindspring.com>.

1998-12-26  Andy Piper  <andy@xemacs.org> 
                and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>
	* CVS can now tunnel connections through web servers (and hence a
	firewall) that support the CONNECT command. The syntax augments the
	connection syntax, for instance
	:pserver#proxy=www#proxyport=8080#port=2401:, where proxy is the
	name of the web server proxy, proxyport is the port to connect to on
	the proxy and port is the remote port to connect to. proxyport
	defaults to 80 and port defaults to 2401.

	* cvs.h: declare proxy variables CVSroot_proxy,
	CVSroot_proxy_port, CVSroot_port.
	* root.c: define proxy variables.
	(parse_cvsroot): pick up semicolon expressions port=, proxy=,
	proxyport= from CVSROOT.
	* client.h (CVS_PROXY_PORT): default port for a proxy.
	* client.c (connect_to_pserver): connect to a proxy before doing
	anything else if one was specified.
	(auth_server_port_number): return CVSroot_port if set.

Mon Jan  25 1999 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* WinCvs 1.0.2 : Integrated the context menu thing of Alex
	Lemaresquier <alex@brainstorm.fr>. Merci alex ;-).
	* WinCvs 1.0.2 : Worked without success on finding memory
	leaks of WinCvs (WinCvs seems to grow the heap when it
	idles, I've no idea why, but it seems to allocate some
	Windows resources).
	* WinCvs 1.0.2 : Re-enabled the threading on Windows-98,
	it seems to be OK now.

Tue Jan  19 1999 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* WinCvs 1.0.2 : More work on DosPipe in order to get
	cvs release to work (in fact popen). "Should" be OK now.

HAPPY NEW YEAR !

Fri Nov  24 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* MacCvs : Jocelyn Houle <houlejo@IRO.UMontreal.CA> did a lot of
	work on the help balloons. This is not 100% complete but it is enough
	complete te release it.
	* MacCvs : Richard Wesley did a bit of work for CWCVS 1.0.
	* MacCvs 1.0 RELEASED !

Fri Nov  18 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* WinCvs : Solved the "cvs co ." problem.

Fri Nov  11 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* MacCvs : Navigation services + some drag'n drop (Jack Jansen).

Fri Oct  30 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* WinCvs : Made the file watcher smoother et clever.
	* WinCvs 1.0 RELEASED !

Mon Oct  26 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* WinCvs : Did the automatic logout + force -d option + version number
	in the splash screen & about dialog.

Fri Oct  23 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* WinCvs : You gonna love it : I did implement the idea of Jason Aten
	<jaten@rosetta.org> to use the notification mechanism : Kick ass. Now
	WinCvs updates automatically the file view when something changed.

Tue Oct  6 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* MacCvs : Cvs/Template support + persistents commit logs/tags...
	* MacCvs : ssh support.
	* Both : cvs status uses "-v" by default now (suggestion of Elliott Bloom).

Tue Oct  4 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* WinCvs : Now the combo box with the default values for the tags,
	dates... are persistents.
	* WinCvs : Cvs/Template support + persistents commit logs.

Tue Oct  3 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* WinCvs : A lot of work on the left view like suggested Jason :
	real ignore/missing support, F5 support, macros selection support,
	navigating to the right view now update the left one...
	* Both side : added a TCL "cvsentries" function + a sample macro
	named "Fast search modified" in order to illustrate it.
	Found a memory leak in CvsIgnore.

Tue Sep  17 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* WinCvs : ~/.cvsignore handling + toggle ignore files button
	* Both sides : Now use STRATA1102 for cvs-1.10.2
	* Both sides : removed the cvs-1.9 support, now cvs-1.0 is far more
	stable than cvs-1.9. The cvs-1.9 folder is now obsolete.

Tue Sep  8 1998 Stephen Wark
	* WinCvs : Bug fix in ListViewEx.cpp

Tue Sep  8 1998 Norbert,Klamann@pobox.com
	* WinCvs : Bug fix for Netware (windows-NT/filesubr.c)

Tue Sep  8 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* WinCvs : finnaly got a solution for pipe : I use a little
	dos application named DosPipe which does the work. It appears
	to be impossible to use anonymous pipes from a MFC app to a Dos
	application. The reason is the lack of console (!?).
	* WinCvs : removed the changes of Jason in src/filesubr.c because
	this file is not intended to compile with VisualC++. The one in
	diff3.c is still there and is still very usefull. According to Jason
	we should free the return of _tempnam (oups! it is used in several places).
	* Both side : found a bug in src/find_names.c. It needs a report.
	* WinCvs : The browser now should expand automatically at startup
	and show-up entirely (it used to be truncated).
	* WinCvs : other little things : an install shield installer
	(./InstallShield), dbl-click in the browser try now to guess the viewer,
	explore selection, send to recycle bin.

Wed Sep  4 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* MacCvs : Completed the Mac side for the macros menus
	and added a new macro.

Wed Sep  2 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* NOW USE STRATA1101 ! Updated the source code from Cyclic.
	* WinCvs : Modified the entry of the dlls so it sets STDIN, STDOUT,
	  STDERR. Now "popen" is working when invoked by "loginfo"
	  in local mode.

Tue Sep 1  15:03:02 1998 Jason Aten <jaten@accessone.com>

	* cvs-1.10\diff\diff3.c:
	* cvs-1.10\src\filesubr.c:
	* cvs-1.9\src\filesubr.c: 
	* in each of the 3 above files, added win32-share safe 
	version of tmpnam() call. It is now possible to update
	to a share that has a protected root directory; diff
	no longer tries to write there.

Fri August  20 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Both side : Added the cvs-1.10 support.
	* Win side : Fixed a little bug about the edit field for getting
	the external diff.

Mon July  6 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Both side : Tag/Rtag support + added some icons to the
	graph log window.
	* Win side : added ssh support (contribution of Noel CRAGG).
	* Win side : misc fix things + external diff support in the graph log
	window (tested with Windiff).

Thu July  2 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Mac side : lot of work including the visual log tree
	(option graph log), cvs-1.9.28 support, .cvsignore support
	(not ~/.cvsignore, not CVS_IGNORE)...

Thu June  18 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Win side : lot of work including the visual log tree
	(option graph log), cvs-1.9.28 support, .cvsignore support
	(not ~/.cvsignore, not CVS_IGNORE)... Hopefully the Mac versoin
	will follow next.
	* CVSTREE : cvstree is a new library cross-platform using bison
	and flex to parse the cvs log output. It can be used in any cvs
	client. WinCVS uses it now in order to draw a tree of the history
	of a revision.

Fri May  29 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1b2
	* Win side : little import bug.
	* Mac side : big import bug + CW Pro3 port + GUSI 1.8.4

Wed May  14 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1b1
	* Win side : Added a contextual menu on the right button. I just
	don't know *what* to put inside, so I put most of the commands.

Wed May  13 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1b1
	* Both side : Fixed a bug when having multi-lines in a log message
	(Gerhard Moeller).
	* Win side : fixed a crash when dropping file in he log window
	(Gerhard Moeller). Now it should print the path name of the files
	in the log window (useful for tcl command line)
	* Win side : implemented a (sort of) dir command for tcl and fixed
	some bug in the log window after entering Enter.
	* Mac side : implemented a keyboard selection for the browser
	(a la Finder). added the ability to toggle/resize/drag windows
	while cvs is running.

Fri May  8 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1b0
	* Both side : integrated cvs-1.9.27.1. Now the 2.0 options
	refers to this version.
	* Win side : fixed several problems reported by Gerhard Moeller.
	* Both side : first draft for an integrated shell using TCL.
	It allows to invoke cvs with arguments directly in the Log window.
	On the mac side I'll ship MacCVS with the TCL shared library because
	I had to fix a problem (see README.TCL). Instructions on how to use
	it are described in INSTALL.txt for WinCVS. I would like to have
	some comments before documenting it and be sure it is useful.
	* Mac side : MACCVS TURNS BETA ! There are few things to complete
	before it is "feature complete" but it seems to be stable now.

Tue May  5 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Mac side : Resolved for CW Pro2 the memory leak due to the
	new/delete handling in the MSL Runtime. You need to change
	your MSL Runtime "New.cpp" : #define NEWMODE NEWMODE_MALLOC.
	When the Fragment Manager calls the newly created __terminate_malloc,
	it will remove the allocs pools used for malloc and new.
	* Mac side : Fixed a bug (OUPS) in the preferences.
	* Mac side : Enhanced the browser so it opens another browser
	when you double click on a folder. The open-finder behaviour is still
	avalaible thru Option-Click.

Fri May  1 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Win side : Removed a security hole reported by Neal Becker.
	Now the user *has* to have a login which conforms with the
	cvs server. So if you use like me "Administrator", you should
	change it to your log name pretty soon ! I think this applies
	only for .rhosts authentication.

Tue Apr  30 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a8
	* Mac side : Finally I run QC (http://www.onyx-tech.com) on
	MacCvs and found several inconsistencies. This version *should*
	be MUCH MORE stable. I also identified the memory leak : it comes
	from the new operator in the runtime library. I need to go thru
	GUSI to suppress it. The browser get enhanced a little bit and
	should just run fine now. Next version of MacCVS 3.1 will probably
	turn 'Beta' ! Alleluia ! :->

Tue Apr  28 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a7
	* Mac side : First preview of the browser (very experimental).
	This version intends to be the one to use for checking out Mozilla
	with a fix of Aleks Totic about long filenames.

Thu Apr  24 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a6
	* Both side : Tested and inserted the monitors (release,
	lock, edit, watch...).

Thu Apr  16 1998 Aleks Totic <atotic@netscape.com>
	* Version 3.1a5
	* Mac side : Released the Aleks's work.
	* Win side : Finished the browser.
	* Both side : added a paranoiac range check for memory in
	the garbage collector that you can turn on optionally if
	you got crashes.

Tue Apr  14 1998 Aleks Totic <atotic@netscape.com>
	* Version 3.1a5
	* Mac side : AppleSingle support. According to Alesks :
	"1) apsingle.* contains the actual encoders/decoders. This code only depends on
	MoreFiles, and can be standalone.
	2) cvs_hqx.cpp is mostly plugging my code in. I did change set_file_type to
	optionally give a warning if the file type is not found in InternetConfig.
	This is because binary files really should have their types set to be useful.
	3) The GUSI file contains that 1-liner change for chdir.
	4) More AS details: AppleSingle format encodes mac files as a series of entries (1 for data fork,
	1 for resource fork, 1 for file's real name, etc). Every entry is optional,
	you can encode as little or as much data as you'd like. To make my code
	generic enough, the encode/decode routines take a flag argument,
	wantedEntries, that is a bit array describing what entries would you like encoded/decoded."

Fri Apr  10 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a4
	* Mac side : prepared the MacCVS side for Aleks Totic
	AppleSingle support. This is not finished but you can
	now set the plain binary mappings interactively.
	* Mac side : for MPW and CWCVS users (and any AppleEvent
	user) : now some variables are "globals". It means that
	if you don't define them, they are read from the
	MacCVS preferences. This will help a lot in order to not make
	mistakes and have to set some preferences only once (ports,
	binary mappings, home...). See the doc for details.
	* Mac side : a bug keep making MacCVS crash, reported
	by Alain Roy. It happens only when MacCVS have finished,
	closed the connection and unloads the cvs
	fragment. I've no idea what's going on so please keep
	hacking this problem. I don't feel like it's dangerous,
	but you may need MacsBug in order to avoid to restart :-<.

Tue Apr  7 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a4
	* Mac side : detected a new bug with the daylight time.
	* Mac side : Removed the @@@ trick for the HOME env. variable :
	now ~/.cvsrc, ~/.cvswrappers should work. Also fixed the
	bug found by Aleks Totic.
	* Mac side : introduced a hack contributed by Roman Dementiev.
	It allows to use the Paul Sanders's WinNT server.
	* Win side : fixed a big bug introduced in the import.
	* Win side : Began also to make a browser. The Mac side
	will follow later.

Fri Apr  3 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a4
	* Mac side : cvs release works now but only with cvs 2.0.
	Some others minors things suggested by Alain Aslag Roy
	for cvs import.

Mon Mar  30 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a3
	* Both side : Fixed the old problem of stdout/stderr getting
	mixed. Now the mpw tools reveive the two channels separately.
	Also MacCvs and WinCvs now take advantage of the two channels...

Mon Mar  30 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a3
	* Both side : Fixed the old problem of stdout/stderr getting
	mixed. Now the mpw tools reveive the two channels separately.
	Also MacCvs and WinCvs now take advantage of the two channels...

Wed Mar  25 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a3
	* Mac side : enhanced a little bit cvslog.
	* Win side : enhanced threads to be able to use MFC
	objects (crash when getting password).
	* Both side : added more dialogs/options.

Fri Mar  20 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a2
	* Mac side : two MPW tools, cvs and cvslog,
	see the documentation.

Wed Mar  18 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a2
	* Both side : First version of a (very) improved import.
	It's now possible to detect errors, force binary, ignore...
	* On the mac side we need now to improve the "plain binary"
	by making a proper interface.

Mon Mar  15 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a1
	* On the Mac side : fixed the bug color.
	* On the Windows side : added local authentication
	support
	* Both side : fixed some memory leaks and improved
	the garbage support for 1.9.26.

Thu Mar  12 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a0
	* On the Mac side : added ports support.
	* On the Windows side : added multi-thread support
	+ a stop button.

Wed Mar  11 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a0
	* On the Mac side : added font selection plus color
	in the log window : but Aaste doesn't want to use
	my colors (?!?), so I use a bold face instead :<
	* On the Windows side : fixed the ports bugs +
	cleaned the documentation (sort of ;-]) + updated
	the command line dialog to have the global settings.

Fri Mar  6 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.1a0 (at least !)
	* A lot of improvements in both WinCvs and MacCVS.
	* MacCvs 3.1a0 uses now powerplant so we'll run less
	problems to make new cvs commands mapping in MacCVS.
	* The 3.1 code lets you use either cvs 1.9 code or
	cvs 1.9.xxx (refered as 2.0). It simply switch the
	good shared library (the same on Windows).
	* It begins to sound good so anytime I can update
	the documentation, I will make a release build...

Wed Feb  18 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.0b5
	* I think cvs 1.9.20 is usable now since I've done
	the encoding/patch/decoding session, the patch can apply
	correctly on the server format. I keep testing.
	* Changed also convert_file to use MSL (and the famous
	toggle \n<->\r) instead of the GUSI (no automatic
	conversion).

Tue Feb  17 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.0b5
	* cvs 2.0 begins to work. I had to slightly reorganize
	the projects so we split MacCVS and the cvs shared library.
	We have now two shared libraries : for cvs 1.9 and future 2.0
	(cvs 1.9.24). This way we can expect the macintosh folder
	to be distributed with the official cvs distribution of Cyclic.
	* Fixed a bug when deleting directories (prune option).

Mon Feb  16 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.0b5
	* Begins work on cvs 2.0 (cvs 1.9.24). I think we can have
	a single application and two shared libraries (1.9 and 2.0).

Tue Feb  3 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.0b5
	* Added a TODO and corrected the top README.

Wed Jan  28 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.0b5
	* Added binary control you the user is warned when it
	tries to add binary files as text files (or the contrary).
	It detects also escape characters, wrong line feeds and
	wrong file types.

Tue Jan  27 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Added ISO-8859-1 translation. Thanks to Jim Matthews.
	Suggestion of ƒric Aubourg. <- (Hey ! Should work now ;->)
	* Added Internet Config on TEXT files (disabled by
	default). Suggestion of Richard Wesley.
	* Fixed a bug which affects all the files picking
	(some files were added with a short DirID).

Wed Jan  16 1998 Miro Jurisic <meeroh@MIT.EDU>
	* Added AE pending event. See PendingAeQueue.[cpp,h]
	for details

Wed Jan  15 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Begin works on kcvs (for KDE desktop)
	* Cleaned common sources
	* Added missing elements to compile on Windows

Wed Jan  8 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* WinCvs Version 1.0b2
		+ Fix temporaly -z9 freeze : see zlib.c
		+ added quiet mode (-q)
		+ worked on the documentation (wincvs.hlp).
		+ cleaned the project.
		+ added find command.
	* MacCvs Version 3.0b4
		+ fixed bugs due to the merge
		+ added quiet mode (-q)

Mon Jan  6 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* WinCvs Version 1.0b1
	* First draft

Fri Jan  2 1998 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.0b4
	* MacCVS uses now native \r carriage return by
	Miro Jurisic <meeroh@MIT.EDU>
	* MacCVS implements the AE core suite by
	Miro Jurisic <meeroh@MIT.EDU>
	* Corrected logo in About box.
	* Provide a work around for a GUSI bug. So added
	the GUSIFile.cpp to the GUSI-Add-ons folder.
	* Added a mail from Miro Jurisic to the documentation
	which explains the MacCVS architecture.

** HAPPY NEW YEAR !! **

Mon Dec  29 1997 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.0b3
	* Added quote handling by Miro Jurisic <meeroh@MIT.EDU>
	* Added dialog and menu baloon helps

Tue Dec  23 1997 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.0b3
	* Fixed bug in client.c when using fgets (the branches
	seem to work now).
	* Added a multi-files dialog for all the command
	which pick a file (commit, add, status...) so the
	user can select several files at once.

Mon Dec  22 1997 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.0b3
	* Added "cvs status" command.
	* Added the bin# resource to set-up plain binary files
	(contribution of Miro Jurisic, meeroh@MIT.EDU)
	* Added GUSI 1.8.3 and removed GUSI.r and GUSI.rsrc
	from maccvs. This change still do not fix our "epoch"
	problem with MSL. But it fixes the problem of the
	creation date of folders.
	* Added a 'README.GUSI' to help people to find and
	compile GUSI : GUSI should not be distributed
	anymore with MacCVS.
	* Fixed move to trash bug (contribution of Miro Jurisic,
	meeroh@MIT.EDU).
	* Worked on look & feel (about dialog, spin cursor,
	application icon...).
	* Added "MacCVS:" to all the errors messages generated
	by MacCVS so the user can understand which side is
	going wrong.

Wed Dec  17 1997 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
	* Version 3.0b2
	* New kserver authentification (contribution of Miro Jurisic,
	meeroh@MIT.EDU).
	* Worked a little bit on the doc (Miro Jurisic suggestion)

Mon Dec  15 1997 Alexandre Parenteau  <alexp@strata3d.com>
