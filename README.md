# ZSNES 2

<img align="right" width="128" height="128" alt="logo" src="icons/128x128x32.png">

The last release of [ZSNES](http://zsnes.sourceforge.net/) was well over 16 years ago. It requires heavy patching and tweaking of compilation flags to build and run on a modern Linux distro.

This is a fork of ZSNES that aims to solve this.

Running `make` produces a 32-bit x86 ELF executable with MMX support, that can be run on a 64-bit x86 system. Large parts of ZSNES is written in 32-bit x86 Assembly, which is not easily ported to other platforms or systems. SSE support is disabled.

Goals and non-goals:

* Compiling ZSNES so that it works on 64-bit x86 is a goal (that has been reached).
* Supporting 32-bit platforms is not a goal, but pull requests are welcome.
* Supporting Windows is not a goal, but pull requests are welcome.
* Supporting modern Linux distros (and FreeBSD, if possible) is a goal.
* To be like an LTS release of ZSNES is a goal.
* Porting ZSNES to SDL2 is a long term goal.
* Adding back a more secure version of the net-play code is a long term goal.

Pull requests that fixes inaccuracies with the emulation are welcome, as well as pull requests for regular bugs.

* Currently, `sdl1` (or better: `sdl12-compat`) is a required dependency.
* The `sdl2` branch is a work-in-progress branch where ZSNES can be compiled with SDL2 but it does not yet run correctly.

Tested on Arch Linux, Fedora and Debian 12 on x86_64.

### Build

    make

For other platforms than Linux, adjust the first 70 lines of the `Makefile` as needed.

### Debug build

Make sure that `gdb` is installed. Then:

    make clean debug

Then type `r` in gdb to run zsnes with the example ROM (`~/roms/snes/example.sfc` must exist). Use ie. `bt full` to see the backtrace if ZSNES crashes.

### Install

    make install

Installing a desktop shortcut is possible. A `zsnes.desktop` file is included in `linux/zsnes.desktop`. It could also be generated with [gendesk](https://github.com/xyproto/gendesk). If you have a suitable icon named `zsnes.png` then they can both be installed with:

    install -Dm644 zsnes.png /usr/share/pixmaps/zsnes.png
    install -Dm644 zsnes.desktop /usr/share/applications/zsnes.desktop

For other platforms than Linux, different flags may apply. ZSNES is primarily one executable, but for UNIX-inspired operating systems, the man page (`man/zsnes.1`) can be installed as ie. `/usr/share/man/man1/zsnes.1` (this is handled by `make install`, though).

### Debian and Ubuntu

Try installing ZSNES from [this flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.xyproto.zsnes), or see if the following commands works for you, on **x86_64**. Please create a PR if they don't:

```sh
dpkg --add-architecture i386
apt update
apt install -y git make nasm pkg-config zlib1g-dev build-essential
git clone https://github.com/xyproto/zsnes
cd zsnes
make
apt install -y g++-multilib gcc-multilib libgl-dev libgl-dev:i386 libpng-dev libpng-dev:i386 libsdl1.2-compat-dev libsdl1.2-compat-dev:i386 libsdl2-dev zlib1g-dev zlib1g-dev:i386
make
```

### Pull requests

* Pull requests are welcome.
* A port to SDL2 is extra warmly welcome!
* Being able to build and run ZSNES on Linux is a priority.
* Please have `clang-format` installed and run `./fmt.sh` before submitting a pull request.

### Windows users

* Compiled executables for ZSNES 1.51 for Windows are available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/zsnes/files/zsnes/ZSNES%20v1.51/
* Pull requests for supporting Windows are welcome, but it's not a goal for this project.

# Old documentation

* Some of the information in the old text files in `docs/readme.txt/*.txt` has not yet been ported over to the `linux/zsnes.1` man page, or to a Markdown document.
* The plan is to do this. Pull requests are welcome.

This is a summary based on the other text files that were not in `docs/readme.txt/*.txt`:

## Additional info from the text files that came with ZSNES 1.51:

### How OpenGL renders the SNES video buffer

The SNES video buffer has dimensions 288x224 (sometimes 288x239 for
certain games; however I have not come across any). The first 16 and last
16 column of pixels are not displayed (perhaps used as a scrolling
buffer?), so the only important part of the video buffer is the middle
256x224 pixels. The SNES video buffer pointer is vidbuffer. With OpenGL,
only the visible 256x224 pixels are needed and they are cropped into
glvidbuffer. glvidbuffer is then turned into a texture that gets bound to
a QUAD whose size depends on whether ZSNES uses aspect ratio to display
each frame.

### Hi-res filters with OpenGL

The video mode selection is taken care of by SDL, including full
screen mode. The current code does not allow for many hi-res filter
options. While it is not difficult to implement the hi-res features using
the current filtering code (in `copyvwin.asm`), it appears that the code for
`copy640x480x16bwin()` causes memory corruption and sometimes segfaults when
you exit ZSNES. For this reason, the filters have been left out. You can,
however, add it in yourself by:

1. Allocating enough memory space for `glvidbuffer` (use `realloc`)
2. Assign `glvidbuffer` to the destination pointer SurfBufD (instead of `surface->pixels`)
3. Setting `Temp1` to `surface->pitch`, i.e. `Temp1 = 2*SurfaceX`
4. Calling `copy640x480x16bwin()`
5. Correctly binding the glvidbuffer as a texture to a QUAD

### Known issues and some work-arounds

* After many video mode switches (all windowed), switching to full screen then back to window mode cases an SDL parachute exit; try not to use too many video mode changes, and restart ZSNES every once in a while if you are just testing out video modes.

* Segfault after having compiled the source -- this might be due to an old `zguicfg.dat` file; delete this and see if the problem gets fixed.

### Issues

#### All ports

- Recode netplay feature, once core is not random anymore.

#### SDL Port

- Low performance due to differences in surface sizes (internal and SDL), make both the same size.
- OpenGL code is awful, incomprehensible, stupid and awful again. We must fix it.
- Support overscan in games like *Dragon Quest 5*

#### Windows port

- OpenGL, or Direct3D support would be nice (we have the source for OpenGL but it needs to be integrated into the main tree, any takers?)
- Windows port should be converted to Direct3D from DirectDraw 7.0.
- Windows sound code needs to be rewritten to reflect the SDL port.

#### Compatibility

- Games not working:
  - *Guikuden 1*
  - *Cu-On-Pa*
  - Loads more
- Graphics Glitches:
  - *Killer Instinct* (black background)
  - *Final Fantasy III* (known as *Final Fantasy VI* in Japan; Range Time Over and other sprite trouble)
  - *Tactic Ogre* (Menus)
  - Lots of others
- Special Chips:
  - DSP1 (99% done)
  - DSP3 (50% done)
  - DSP4 (99% done)
  - SA-1 (95% done)
  - SPC7110 (Needs decompression)
  - SFX1/2 (95% done)
  - Seta 11 (25% done)
  - Seta 18 (1% done)
  - BS-X (50% done)

#### Timing engine

- Convert counter to 32-bit. (assigned to pagefault).
- Fix 65816 timing and take into consideration cycle differences in 8/16-bit mode, branches etc.

#### Graphics Engine

- Fix some windowing/sub-screen sprite problems that are still present in the new graphics engine. Probably pagefault will have to do this.
