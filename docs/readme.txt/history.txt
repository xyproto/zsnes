The following is the history of ZSNES, including the changelogs for every
official ZSNES release, and other major events. ZSNES was first released on
October 14, 1997.

Spanning the releases between version 0.715 and version 0.990, an ASM-only
version was offered alongside the normal ASM+C version. Differences between
sister C/A releases are marked as appropriate.

Note: All changelogs before v1.40 were copied from their original text source
inside the ZSNES official release packages. We edited the old changelogs as
little as possible in order to minimize the accidental loss of information.
Therefore, you may find spelling mistakes and formatting differences between
different versions.

v1.50 - December 22, 2006
............................................................

All Ports:
----------
For this release, we spent much time rewriting, porting, and improving many
internal subsystems. ZSNES is a program with over 200,000 lines of source code,
and in this release, over 25% of that has been modified; also, around 15% of the
assembly has been ported to C. The upcoming list, while large, can't fully
describe the amount of work done and the amount of improvements made. Be sure to
see the readme to find out how to use all the new features.

  Subsystem Additions/Updates/Rewrites/Fixes/Improvements
  ----------
  - Ryan C. Gordon's ManyMouse support added. [Nach, pagefault]
    This allows the systems compatible with ManyMouse (Windows XP, Linux via
    evdev if read permission set, Mac OS X) to handle each mouse plugged into
    the system separately. So now games with two mouse-using devices can be
    played with 2 players (or 1 player controlling both) on a single PC.
    Left Handed Mouse Support. [Nach, Deathlike, Jonas Quinn]
    So lefties can have the buttons for a particular mouse swapped if they so
    desire.
  - Rewrote directory handling system. [Nach, Jonas Quinn, grinvader, Deathlike]
    The old system, dubbed "ZFile", only kept track of files in a limited manner
    allowing for many many bugs. The new system, dubbed "ZPath", now tracks
    files and paths in a clean systematic manner to eliminate all file/path
    related bugs that have made previous versions annoying. All file handling
    code is now done in C and has many functions to make it easier for anyone
    else to jump right into this bit of development. This also allows for many
    new features to be written, and we wrote quite a few. A debug system has
    also been added, making it easy to track file issues regardless of the
    operation system in question.
  - ZMV Rewritten - Movie Support. [Nach, grinvader, ipher]
    Added support for subtitles while playing a ZMV. [Nach]
    Can now load movies via command line parameter. [Nach]
    Added parameter to close ZSNES when movie is closed. [Nach]
    Our movie subsystem - ZMV has been completely rewritten from the ground up.
    Now features such as rerecording (via states and rewind), appending, mouse
    recording, Super Scope recording (buggy), chapters, start types, frame
    count, input compression, among other things are now all supported. Note
    ZSNES can still load old ZMVs; however, it should be noted that ZMVs are
    somewhat version reliant and may desync on a version it was not recorded
    with. Also, most of the new features will not work when using an old ZMV.
  - Can now dump ZMVs to AVI and WAV. [Nach, Bisqwit]
    For years, users have requested being able to convert a ZMV to something
    else; it is now possible.
  - Added IPS multipatch support. Goes from IPS, IP0, IP1, IP2, ..., IP9. [Nach]
    So you can have IPS autopatching apply more than one to a game loaded.
    IPS files now loaded from save directory then ROM directory. [Nach]
    Making it easier for a user to auto patch.
    Fixed silly mistake with size adjustment of IPS patches. [Nach]
    So now the very rare broken IPS should work.
  - Rewind and ZST code fully merged; rewind should now work where save states
    do (Fixes rewinding in Super Bomberman games). [grinvader, Nach]
    Can now use 100 save states instead of 10. [Deathlike, Nach, Jonas Quinn]
    SRAM is now stored in save states and can be optionally loaded from them.
    [grinvader, Nach]
    Can now select how many rewind states you want. [grinvader, Nach, ipher]
    Can now select how much time is in between rewinds. [grinvader, Nach, ipher]
    Our state saving subsystem has been completely rewritten (although another
    rewrite is planned) to fix many bugs that used to be present. With the ZST
    and rewind code merged, it also means no more issues where one works but not
    the other. This is also now all done in C, making it easier to deal with, as
    well as allowing many new features as listed above.
  - Parsegen invented (thanks grinvader, gladius). [Nach]
    Binary and text config files merged into one and heavily updated. [Nach,
    grinvader, Deathlike]
    We invented a new programming language (PSR), and a compiler for it
    (parsegen), which allows one to keep track of variables in a simple manner
    for both developers and end users. Developers can just declare a particular
    variable to be tracked and forget about it, letting the system manage
    everything else, making it easy to add as many configuration options as one
    likes. For the end user, the config file is all in text, making it easy to
    modify any feature they like or features for advanced users not changeable
    from within the GUI. It also provides a level of future compatibility so
    users should normally not have to delete config files between versions. It
    also allows partial config files, so users can delete certain settings and
    have them restored to their defaults. All this is possible while maintaining
    a high level of flexibility.
  - Netplay, Modem, IPX code removed. [grinvader, Nach. ipher]
    As much as we hated to do this, we had to remove all computer-to-computer
    playing options in order to fix up the other subsystems since the code was
    spread throughout ZSNES. We hope to reimplement it in future versions and
    also provide new features.
  - Created new macros and greatly eased GUI development and cut down on size of
    GUI code. [ipher]
    Cleaned up GUI and reorganized it. [ipher, Nach, grinvader, Deathlike,
    Jonas Quinn]
    Added tab support to the GUI and made good use of it. [grinvader]
    Rewrote the load game menu, it can now handle thousands upon thousands of
    ROMs at a time. [Nach, grinvader]
    Added a custom font system. [ipher, Deathlike]
    Nach input boxes (video, path) now have a normal blink rate. [Nach]
    Now using our custom GUI should be easier and more straight forward. Almost
    everywhere you look, you should see a cleaner design, new features, and
    fewer bugs. See below for more specifics.
  - New unified ZSNES loader which is also less buggy. [Nach, grinvader,
    Deathlike, Jonas Quinn]
    Now command line options are handled in a more efficient manner, as well as
    making it much easier for us to add more.
  - Committed the ZSNES development toolkit. [Nach, grinvader]
    Code is now always in executable sections, fixes NX and many other issues.
    [Nach]
    Added utility to auto detect best -march option to compile with; SDL port
    uses it automatically. [Nach, grinvader]
    For various developers, we now added many utilities to make working on ZSNES
    much easier. Some of these utilities should be built into the assembler but
    aren't. These new utilities have also allowed us to easily track down
    several critical bugs and fix them effortlessly. We also have a utility now
    to aid the person compiling to get the best optimization out of their build,
    perhaps now allowing them to use HQ4x or other filters that weren't possible
    before.
  - Updated build setups. [grinvader, Nach]
    Added file dependency utility. [Nach]
    All the build setups have been updated to make it easier and more flexible
    for one to compile ZSNES and encounter fewer bugs along the way. File
    dependencies can now also be calculated automatically (most notably for
    SDL), so one updating ZSNES doesn't run into weird issues with only half of
    a fix being compiled.
  - Ported much assembly to C.
    [grinvader, Deathlike, Nach, Jonas Quinn, theoddone33, pagefault, byuu]
    Removed dead code. [grinvader, Nach, pagefault, Jonas Quinn, Deathlike]
    Lastly on our big rewrite, a lot of old junk went, and many complex and
    annoying features are now in C, meaning that if you know C, now is a good
    time to start helping out ZSNES development.

  Special Chips

    all the emulators that use hacks). [pagefault, grinvader, Nach, Jonas Quinn]
  - Fixed small screen extra line issues (fixes Super Metroid annoying
    line issue, so now that guy who keeps on coming into the channel
    annoying us about it can rest in peace). [pagefault, Nach]

zsKnight Leaves - July 23, 2001
............................................................

I'm sorry to say this, but this marks my permanent leave from the ZSNES project,
anything related to this, and emulation overall. The reason why is that my dad
just passed away today (he died in his sleep, which is strange since he was
perfectly healthy yesterday night), so I'm going to have to spend more of my
energy devoted to helping my family. My dad is also the main person who provides
the finances to the family (since my mom doesn't work), plus I still have about
2 more years to go before I graduate from university, so my immediate future
doesn't look that great because with my dad gone, that would mean that I need to
put up more responsibility towards taking care of the family instead of
studying. But I just hope that everything will go well. Thanks to all you
supporters for everything. Sorry for the lack of a proper goodbye though, so
I'll probably update once more after I get out of this shock in another day.

v1.20b, Win v0.88 - April 30, 2001
............................................................

  - Final Fantasy Mystic Quest works again.
  - Fixed Empire Strikes Back crashing bug in the millenium falcon
    sequence (hopefully this will fix some other games too)
  - Removed all self-modifying code in ZSNES.  This will make ZSNES crash
    a lot less on certain systems, especially during mode 7 sequences.
    Thanks Ivar!
  - Implemented S-RTC chip, using the system clock as the actual time
    (The game will make you set the time though, but it will just be replaced
    with the system time in-game).  Thanks to John Weidman and Dark Force
    for the info on this chip!
  - Fixed crashing bug in certain mosaic scenes (eg. FF3 Phantom Forest)
    in the new graphics engine
  - Fixed a nasty crashing/corruption bug in the new graphics engine
    (both 8bit and 16bit)
  - SPC7110 emulation!  This is based on the information reverse engineered by
    the hard working folks at dejap translations, Dark Force and John Weidman.
  - Altered HiROM/LoROM detection a bit - Fievel goes West works now
  - Open source preparations [teuf]
  - In-game clock working for the windows port.  [kode54]
  - Fixed a memory leak problem in the new graphics engine [TRAC]
  - Added Cubic Spline Interpolation [Anti Resonance]
  - Fixed a assign/compare size bug in the new graphics engine [TRAC]
  - Fixed b flag setting in BRK instruction in 6502 emulation mode [zsKnight]
  - Added SPC7110 logger file output to help in the filesize clipping of
    the SPC7110 data files [zsKnight]
  - Fixed a memory leak bug, fixing that nasty Win2K crash bug [Matthew Kendora]
  - Fixed key combination release [Maxim]
  - Fixed source code warnings/added necessary includes [Maxim]
  - Added high priority mode for Windows 2000 users and slower
    computers (works on Windows 9x as well) [pagefault]
  - Added large sound buffer option for people having DirectSound problems.
    [pagefault]
  - Fixed problem with ZSNESW and Opera causing a BSOD. [pagefault]
  - Fixed up error reporting for people experiencing problems. [pagefault]
  - Improved performance on 3dfx cards by compiling with DirectX 8 SDK.
    [pagefault]
  - Fixed a sound problem with people with messed up config files. [pagefault]
  - Fixed FF3 flashing line problem [zsKnight]
  - Fixed mysterious sprite disappearing bug in the new graphics engine
    [zsKnight]
  - Reduced noise in ToP opening theme.  It works fine in the DOS port,
    but the windows port still seems to produce some static, probably
    because of the way how sound is updated in that port. [zsKnight]
  - Updated Super 2xSaI and Super Eagle code (should be much faster
    now on MMX processors) [Kreed, added by pagefault]
  - Added gzip support [teuf]
  - Added support for ViBRA16 cards [Peter Santing]
  - No longer requires zlib.dll file, now statically linked. ZSNESw won't crash
    anymore if you try to load a .zip file without that dll file. [pagefault]
  - Now compiled using an optimising compiler [pagefault]
  - Almost a fully re-written DSP-1 emulation engine!
    [zsKnight, theoddone33, pagefault, teuf].  Also thanks to CrASH_Man
    for the 3x3 inverse matrix formula.
  - Fixed memory leak problem in the windows port during exit [pagefault]
  - And more ...

Source Code Released - April 2, 2001
............................................................

The ZSNES Sources have finally been released in the CVS repository of the
sourceforge page. We also would like to welcome Teuf as a member of the ZSNES
team as an assistant coder! He's helped us with quite a lot in the past while,
including (but not limited to) setting up the Source Forge page, helping us to
write the open source documentation, fixing up the ZSNES sources to not require
a custom version of nasm, organizing the sources into directories, modifying the
make file, etc. With the sources released, we also hope to release an updated
binary soon. Click on the Sourceforge link on the left side of the screen to
access the sources. The sources will also be available in a ZIP file for those
who don't want to use CVS.


............................................................
v1.17b - December 27, 2000
............................................................

  * A nasty bug has crept into the DOS version in the 8-bit video modes,
    so a fixed version (v1.17b) is released (it has the same filename as
    v1.17 so just overwrite it).


............................................................
v1.17, Win v0.85 - December 25, 2000
............................................................

  - Added slow-down key.  You can configure it in Misc -> Game Keys
  - Invulnerability bug of the 3rd boss in Demon's Crest in the
    good checksum roms is fixed through rom mirroring
    I also noticed that this fix is the same as what the author of SNEeSe
    told me before about on some MegamanX1 roms, but I never had that rom
    so I never added this until now.  Guess that rom is also fixed too.
  - Changed memory initialization values - Lost Viking 2 works again
  - 65816: Fixed WAI instruction timing with HIRQ's
    Top Gear 2 - 2 player mode works now
  - Improved IRQ re-execution timing precision
  - Starfox 2 beta now runs with sound!
  - Fixed flickering problem in Starfox 2 beta
  - Added Mode 2 16x16 tile offset per tile mode
  - (Win32) Improved the timestamps on UDP headers.  This should (hopefully)
    solve those out of sync (where both sides see different things) problems
    with certain connections (ie. T1/LAN connections) in netplay.
  - (Win32) Added a big notice in netplay.txt.  For all of you who used
    netplay and had poor experiences with a ping time of less than 300ms,
    read it!  Also added a more realistic system requirements description
    for decent netplay in netplay.txt rather than a cpu speed estimate.
  - Changed reverse stereo method to become invisible to the sound
    registers in emulation


............................................................
v1.14, Win v0.80 - November 27, 2000
............................................................

  - Fixed configuration files from removing spaces from directory names
  - (DOS) Fixed 640x480 vesa2 scanline+interpolation display problem
  - (Win32) Improved Windows speed in 32-bit windowed mode.
    Should give around an 18% speed increase in FPS.
  - (Win32) More netplay improvements.  Shouldn't be as jumpy when
    one side lacks input.
  - (Win32) Starting netplay will now force the max frameskip to 3
    if it is less than it and also force on auto frameskip.
  - (Win32) MMX optimised netplay with back buffer enabled.
  - (Win32) Fixed load state in netplay to load properly instead
    of sometimes stalling for no reason
  - (DOS) Accidently deleted the code to initialize IPX.  Fixed now.
  - Fixed a configuration loading problem when loading ZSNES from
    a different directory.
  - (Win32) Attempted to fix those out of sync problems (although
    I don't know if it's fixed now since those problems rarely happen to me)
  - (Win32) Displayed the current filename in the load window
    for those files with extra long names.
  - (Win32) Added nickname support to NetPlay.  There's a 9 character
    nickname size limit.
  - (Win32) Added actions to chat (similar to how mIRC works - use
    /me <action> )
  - (Win32) Nicknames can be changed in the windowed chat by typing
    /nick <new nickname>
  - Added a small buffer to the in-game chat to allow up to 5 chat
    strings displayed at once.
  - Local chat strings now appear in that buffer
  - Thickened black borders on the 5x5 font
  - Extended in-game chat length by around 30 characters
  - Fixed up Interpolation


............................................................
v1.12, Win v0.74 - November 14, 2000
............................................................

  - (Win32) Hopefully fixed up those green display bugs in
    scanlines/2xSaI in 1:5:5:5 16bit modes.
  - (Win32) Improved lost packet recovery time and reduced the number of
    lost packet stalls in UDP netplay (should produce more fluid netplay)
  - (Win32) Fixed up crashing bug in Tales of Phantasia with a 512 byte header
  - Extended filename length of the Quick Menu
  - (Win32) Hopefully fixed up the mouse wheel support for certain mice
  - Temp .ZIP directory is now cleared if it exists prior to another
    .ZIP file being loaded.
  - (Win32) Improved DirectInput error handling


............................................................
v1.11, Win v0.72 - November 12, 2000
............................................................

  - (Win32) ZSNESw won't crash anymore if you don't have a soundcard
    or if DirectSound fails to initialize.
  - (Win32) Fixed a nasty performance bug with certain types of
    joystick/drivers installed, causing the FPS to be slower for no reason.
  - (Win32) Wrote an MMX optimised blitter for 16bit non-D windowed
    and full screen modes.
  - (Win32) Added simple wheel mouse support.


............................................................
v1.10, Win v0.70 - November 7, 2000
............................................................

  - Fixed games that turns on the x239 resolution (eg. Chrono Trigger
    battles) when scanline mode is enabled
  - (Win32) Fixed up crashing bugs on extra long filenames with underscores
  - (Win32) Hopefully fixed the odd colored interpolation in 1:5:5:5 16bit
    color settings
  - (Win32) Hopefully won't crash anymore when the temporary directory
    exists prior to unzipping a .zip file
  - (Win32) Fixed loading of .zip files with more than 2 '.'s in the
    filename.  Thanks to DCX for helping us troubleshoot this.
  - (Win32) Fixed up short filename saveram/save states loading when
    the long filename has spaces in it.
  - Added TCP/IP Support.  It is recommended that for playable netplay,
    you'd have an average ping time of less than 300ms (type
    ping <ip address> in dos) and that packet loss is minimal for TCP/IP
    (not UDP).  At the moment, you cannot have more than 2 connections
    Thanks for all the testers for testing this, especially DooMStalK,
    GreenImp, and TeleKawaru!  Also added back buffer support.  This
    will sacrifice cpu power for netplay to make it much more playable.
    WARNING: High cpu speed recommendations (~450mhz+).
             Please see netplay.txt for details.
  - Added save states to netplay (just use them like you normally do)
  - Save Ram is now defaulted to load/save on the server's side
    Save Ram are not supported in SA-1/SuperFX games due to their size,
    but you can use save states instead in that case.
  - Increased chat line length in the out-of-game chatbox by a lot
  - Partly increased the chat line length in-game
  - in-game chat text now stays longer on-screen by 2 seconds
  - Added reset in netplay
  - Fixed up movie recording feature
  - (Win32) Mouse shouldn't get stuck on the left side anymore.
  - (Win32) Video mode 3 (256x224FS) shouldn't crash anymore.  Thanks
    to kode54 for his assistance on the above 2 bugfixes.
  - (Win32) Fixed the instability bug where the window can sometimes
    start shaking for no reason and takes away windows resources.
  - (Win32) Re-wrote keyboard character input routines
  - Fixed up FF2(4)'s music in lower sampling rates
  - (Win32) Coded in the UDP protocol as a replacement for TCP/IP.
    Some network configurations won't work with UDP.  However, it is strongly
    recommended that you use UDP if you can because of the speed increase.
    In order to disable UDP and use TCP/IP, both sides must de-select UDP.
  - (Win32) Added a small multiplayer game list (multi.txt)
  - Added an updated Windows FAQ, courtesy of TuxedoMsk of VGNetwork
    who updated it.
  - Added a more user friendly input selection routine (changed Direct Input
    to Keyb/Joystick and it also auto-sets keyb/Joystick when you set a key)
  - Hopefully fixed up the sprite priority problems (eg. FF2/4's damage points)
  - (Win32) Added rewind support for up to 8 levels (in 8 second intervals)
    (NOTE: Windows Port only! - Sorry DOS Port users).  In order to activate
    this, assign a key to the Rewind Key in the Misc -> GameKeys option.
  Note: Netplay plays really nice as long as the net connection is not
        unstable, both sides have a fast cpu  (speed requirements depend
        on the game), and at least have a 28.8 connection.
  *** PLEASE READ ZSNESW.TXT IF YOU ARE STILL HAVING PROBLEMS WITH
      THE WINDOWS PORT


............................................................
v1.01 - September 9, 2000
............................................................

  - Fixed a problem with offset per tile mode with MMX2 in the new 16bit engine
  - Fixed crashing problem in MMX2 (Win port)
  - Removed clock option (Win port)
  - Disabling the new graphics 16bit engine is now properly saved
    in the configuration files
  - Added the win port version number to the about box (Win port)
  - Fixed the % of execution problem in IPX/Modem modes


............................................................
v1.000 - September 1, 2000 - First Windows Release
............................................................

  - Implemented C4 emulation :
      - C4 Sprite structure -> OAM conversion routines
      - Sprite Rotate/Scale ability
      - Sprite disintegrate function
      - All in-game used math co-processor functions (hopefully)
      - Both wireframe modes
      - There are still some problems with C4 emulation, but I'd
        consider them to be quite minor to just leave them there.
      Thanks to StarCreator for recording a bunch of movies off
        of the real snes for me to compare!
  - Tweaked ADSR a bit
  - Decreased envelope when key on is issued while sound is still playing.
    This fixed static/popping sound bugs that affected many games.
  - Added the ability to select the Add-on device (Snes Mouse/Super Scope)
    from the GUI through the Add-on option in the Config Menu
  - Added a hack to allow the mouse to control the cursor in Lethal Enforcers
    (Press '7' 4 times to activate or select it from the Add-on option in the
    Config Menu).  Unfortunately, this method has problems (ie. mouse moves
    things that it shouldn't) but it should be good enough, especially for
    those who asked for this.  I doubt this works in LE2, however.
  - Added a manual load entry box so that you can type in the
    filenames/directories manually or type in part of the filename and the GUI
    will seek to whichever filename contains or closely contains that part
  - Pharos coded a water effect, getting help from Scott Scriven's
    water effect code.
  - You can enable/disable the Water Effect and Snow Effect from the
    GUI Options (MISC Menu in the GUI)
  - Implemented Sprite Windowing to the new gfx 8bit engine.  This
    completes all the features that I have planned for that engine.
  - Fixed a really nasty stereo bug that caused volume levels/pans
    to sound completely off on one of the speakers
  - Added player 5 as a normal player instead of just being available
    in modem/ipx play
  - Implemented an option to turn in-game messages/fps display to be transparent
  - Added a Set Keys feature to the Input Routines in the GUI that
    allows you to set all of the standard SNES keys all at once
    instead of clicking on the inputs separately to set them
  - Ported the new graphics 8bit engine to 16bit:
      - All the standard snes features from the 8bit engine
      - Works with all 16bit resolution modes/effects
      - Ported high resolution Mode 7
      - Added proper main/sub screen support and windowing support
      - Added all transparencies modes
      - Added Direct Color Mode7
      - 2xSaI and 50/75% scanlines can now co-exist with high resolution modes
      - This is now the default engine for 16bit.  Some games won't
        work well with this engine such as some SuperFX games (eg. Stunt
        Race FX in the menus).  You can switch back to the old graphics
        engine by pressing the '8' key.
      - Implemented a dual cache system in the tile modes.  I don't know
        how much of a speed increase this gives since my system can already
        run the old graphics engine at full speed and framerate.
      - Full 15bit transparencies for MMX cpus only.
  - High Resolution Mode7 can be toggled on/off in the Video Options.
    It is disabled by default since this feature requires a fast CPU.
  - Added 48khz sound sampling rate
  - Tweaked VBlank timing  a bit
  - Tweaked 65816 CPU cycle execution a bit
  - Added Kreed's Super 2xSaI engine.  It's written in C,
    so it requires a really fast cpu to run it.
  - Added picture preview to the save states in the F3 window.
    Newly created save states will contain a small picture in them.
    Pictures will not appear in old save states, however.


............................................................
v0.991 - May 24, 2000
............................................................

  - Disabled 2xSaI/Super Eagle when in the GUI
  - Fixed up cheat code search (Got broken in v0.990 during port preparation)


............................................................
v0.990 - May 24, 2000
............................................................

  - Added speed hack for Kirby Super Star (US)
  - SPC700 (Sound cpu emulation) is now enabled by default whether
    sound is enabled or not.  Emulation will now be slower than normal
    if you usually run with sound off, but the compatibility is higher.
    However, you can disable this through the options window in the GUI
    if speed is of your concern.  Also, a few games only run with it
    disabled so this option may be useful in those cases.
  - Decreased cheat code description length by 1 since the last
    letter was causing some corruption to the next cheat code
  - Added an option to raise the pitch level to the pre-v0.989
    pitch levels, mainly for non-Creative brand sound cards.
  - You can now change the sound settings (Enable Sound, Stereo,
    Sound Frequency) with immediate effects without re-starting ZSNES.
    However, there seems to be some problems with stereo switching
    on SB Live!'s.
  - Configuration is now saved whenever you exit the GUI instead
    of just exiting the program
  - Lots of port preparation done on the source.
  + Memory/Commandline fix on the C version.  A version should
    not be needed anymore (hopefully)
  - The GUI is now using the standard in-game video blitter rather than it own.
  - Fixed up SnapShot key in 8bit mode
  - Implemented 4-point gaussian interpolation.  This is the interpolation used
    by the actual snes!  Many thanks goes to Neill Corlett for his work on
    finding this info! Of course, this routine takes up an extra cpu load so
    emulation will slow down a bit if your computer isn't fast enough, but
    you can always disable interpolation through the sound options.
  - Fixed up Pitch Modulation method.  Thanks again, Neill!
  - Pitch modulation was modulating from the wrong channel.  Fixed.
  - Tweaked SuperFX timing.
  - Added a move window feature to the F1 menu
  - Expanded filename length in the GUI display for long filenames
    by 3, but had to decrease the directory name by 2.
  - Added support for % codes in long filenames


............................................................
v0.9891c/a - February 21, 2000
............................................................

  - Slightly changed SB16 initialization
  - Forgot to remove DSP1 debug code
  - Fixed a pitch modulation bug when Voice 0 modulates Voice 1.
    Thanks to kode54 for this fix!


............................................................
v0.989c/a - February 12, 2000
............................................................

  - Fixed some SA-1 sudden slowdowns.  This does slow down the overall
    emulation speed in SA-1 games though.
  - All sounds were being played at the wrong pitch (slightly higher
    than normal.  It's now fixed so Zsnes should sound better now.
    Thanks to kode54 for helping out here!


............................................................
v0.988c/a - December 6, 1999
............................................................

  - Added some SA-1 speed hacks (Kirby DX/Parodius 3)
  - Implemented SDD-1 MMC.  But none of the SDD-1 games run properly yet
    because of the compression chip.
  - Fixed up some slowdown problems in SA-1 games
  - Fixed up dirty CPUID fix for Cyrix CPUs so that you don't have to
    re-run Zsnes twice every time.


............................................................
v0.987c/a - November 26, 1999
............................................................

  - Forgot to re-enable pitch modulation after disabling it for debugging
    purposes.


............................................................
v0.986c/a - November 23, 1999
............................................................

  - Re-added Sound Buffering.  I was hoping to re-write it, but
    later found out that it wasn't worth the trouble.
  - Fixed some Triple Buffering bugs, but I can't figure out that
    flicker glitch on NVidia cards
  - Added Simulated Triple Buffering for cards without VESA 3.0 Hardware
    triple buffering.  This method does some lose frames, but should be
    faster than v-sync.  This only works on VESA 2.0 modes.
  - Fixed up directory sorting to always put ./.. at the top.


............................................................
v0.985c - November 15, 1999
............................................................

  - Added some more speedups to the SA-1
  - SA-1: Fixed a branch problem with the BRL instruction
  - Implemented Save Ram support into netplay.
    Thanks to The Minder for help testing this!
  - Added a hack to get Mario Paint trainered rom with the trainer
    removed to work with the snes mouse instead of the keyboard/joystick
  - Prevented Joystick Keys/Buttons to be selected as the diagonal
    keys in the GUI
  - Fixed some crashing problems with the Modem Mode
  - Implemented a key combination editor in the GUI
  - Sped up V-Sync
  - Fixed an SA-1 memory map bug!  Fixes DBZ:HD.
  - Added an small speed hack for DBZ:HD
  - Implemented SA-1 Super MMC
  - Finally, after many, many hours of hacking.  Figured out
    what caused the odd noise sounds!  So far, simulated noise
    is implemented since the true nature of how this noise
    is produced is unknown so it will sound somewhat off compared
    to the original sounds.  There is also a slight chance that
    some sounds will become noise incorrectly and vice versa.
  - Fixed up Pitch Modulation
  - Fixed SNES Mouse/Super Scope support when Pl3/4 as Pl1/2 option is enabled
  - ADSR/GAIN overhaul (Sound DSP) :
      - Fixed several GAIN bugs
      - Implemented Increase Bentline/Decrease Exp GAIN modes properly
      - Rewrote Decay/Sustain modes in ADSR
      - Fixed a restarting ADSR bug
  - Removed Sound Buffering.  I don't think it's worth losing the
    quality of the sound for a small amount of speed boost.
  - Implemented an option to disable the Noise Simulation for those
    games that aren't working properly because of it
  - Implemented Triple Buffering.  You can enable this through the
    Video Options in the GUI.  Unfortunately, Triple Buffering
    won't work with 2xSaI/Super Eagle engine at the moment since they
    rely on the previous screen for updating nor will it work
    properly with high resolution games in the old gfx engine.
    Thanks to GreenImp for patiently helping through testing!
  - Implemented Full Screen Interpolation.  Only works on
    MMX CPU's at the moment.
  - Implemented Cheat Code Reflector (See Guinotes.txt for details)
  - Any proper VESA 2 error messages now doesn't exit the program
    when in the GUI but instead display the error message in a
    box and allows the user to continue.
  Thanks to Daniel for lending me his copier which helped me hack the
    SNES Sound Noise/ADSR stuff!


............................................................
v0.963c/a - September 19, 1999
............................................................

    NOTE : You cannot run DSP1 games, use IPX support, or use .ZIP files in the
          assembly only version.  Use v0.963c for those features.  The only time
          when you should use this version is if v0.963c doesn't work for you.
  - Fixed DMA position reader to fix the high sample rate problem
    in SB-Live! cards.  Thanks to ShihTzu for helping us with this!
  - Removed SB16 only message under stereo option in commandline help.
    Shouldn't really be there since v0.600.
  - Low Pass Filter is now disabled by default.  But you can still
    enable it through the GUI.
  - Implemented an option in the GUI to not allow Zsnes to change
    the current start-up game path in the configuration.  You can
    access this in Config->Options.
  - Joystick calibration values have been reset since there seems
    to be some problems with it.  You may have to re-calibrate your
    joystick if it doesn't respond correctly.


............................................................
v0.962c/a - September 18, 1999

  - Exit text now only displays when text mode is 80x25
  - Used hardware DMA counter to determine which sound block to write to rather
    than assuming it always starts at the first one for the sound routines.
    This should hopefully fix all those nasty sound static problems many people
    seems to have.  Many thanks to Crono for the code and for his help!
  - Removed Re-Init Every 30 Second option.  Shouldn't be needed anymore
  - Added the ability to disable the Low Pass Filter
  - Implemented Diagonal Keys
  - Implemented some SA-1 speedups

A Only:
    NOTE : You cannot run DSP1 games, use IPX support, or use .ZIP files in the
          assembly only version.  Use v0.962c for those features.  The only time
          when you should use this version is if v0.962c doesn't work for you.

  - Fixed an echo delay bug
  - Hopefully fixed the random beep encounter bug that
    occurs in some games with sound enabled
  - Several sound volume fixes
  - Sorry about those new problems in v0.941c.  We traced some of the
    problems to the dos extender zsnes was using (thanks Maxim- for
    some help on this!) so we spent some time rewritng the file system
    so that it would be compatible with other extenders in pure dos.

v0.900c/a - July 4, 1999
............................................................

    NOTE : You cannot run DSP1 games, use IPX support, or use .ZIP files
           in the assembly only version
  - Fixed another sprite priority bug
  + A:  Fixed an IRQ problem that was caused during the C -> ASM conversion
  - HBlank is supposed to be noticed during VBlank
  - Fixed an IRQ bug that occured between v0.715 and v0.800

  - Rewrote 65816 flag handling system.
  - Optimised SA-1 emulation
  - Optimised the 65816 main loop.
  - Implemented Surround Sound.  It is defaulted off since it seems
    to create some bad static in some games.  Thanks to Crono for info!
  - Wrote Interpolation in MMX.  MMX cpu is required.
  - Implemented MMX auto-detection for MMX Interpolation and MMX Copy.
  - Fixed an 224HDMA line bug, thanks to Gary Henderson!
  - Optimised 320x240x16b and 640x480x16b for ARGB cards.
  - Removed Snow
  - Clock option is now visible to anyone.  You can enable the in-game clock
    through the GUI in Config->Options.
  - Altered method of writing to file in Movie Recording mode, hoping that
    it will fix some problems after recording movies for a long period of time.
  - Altered data alignment size in source
  - Fixed a VESA2 divide by 0 bug in Banshee cards by checking
    the scanline length instead of setting it immediately.
    Thanks to Crono for some help!
  - Altered sound echo volume
  - Added sound interpolation based on Crono's code.
    Thanks to Crono for his help!
  - Added an option to turn off sound interpolation for speed
  - Implemented Pitch Modulation, thanks goes to Gary Henderson for
    clarification info!
  - Implemented an option in the GUI (Config->Options) to allow the
    Fast Forward key to act as a toggle (disabled by default)
  - Fixed a bug that prevented high resolution to sometimes not display
    in a 16bit video mode
  - Fixed a game stalling bug when pressing F3 during games that are
    sensitive to changes in the ENVX DSP register (Bomberman Series)
  - Added a hack for the graphic glitches in Dragon Quest 6
  - Fixed up in-game clock in the new gfx 16bit engine
  - Fixed a nasty bug in the ADSR engine.  It was sometimes using
    an incorrect decay value, causing the sound to stick instead of fading out
  - Slightly fixed ADSR by completely skipping the attack stage when
    the attack duration is 0
  - Fixed a GAIN decrease->increase bug
  - Implemented a safe recovery feature for those computers that
    don't support the CPUID instruction (used for MMX detection).
    If ZSNES crashes at the very start, just re-run it.
  - Fixed a fixed color dual windowing bug in the subscreen which caused
    transparency to sometimes shift unexpectedly when the background scrolls
  - Implemented 50% Scanlines (Lance McKay's idea) and 25% Scanlines (Similar
    to Snes9x TV-Mode's scanline intensity) in 640x480x65536 video mode.
    These modes don't work on videocards with an ARGB setting yet.
  - Added MMX Support to 50% and 25% Scanlines modes
  - Implemented back buffer clear in MMX
  - .CHT files now saves to the proper save directory
  - Implemented the 2xSaI graphics engine (MMX Only).  Many thanks
    to Kreed for this wonderful engine and source code!
  - Implemented Kreed's Super Eagle engine.  Note that for both
    2xSaI and Super Eagle, you need an MMX processor, enough RAM for
    the new gfx 16bit engine, and also be in 640x480x65536 video mode.
  - Implemented an option to auto-load a .cht file whenever a game is loaded.
    You can find this option at the bottom of the Cheat Window in the GUI.
  - Optimised Non-MMX Interpolation
  - Fixed a bug that caused save states to not save correctly after
    attempting to load a non-existing .cht file
  - Added a Quick SnapShot Key.  You can set this key in the
    Misc -> GameKeys menu in the GUI.  This key allows you to take
    a snapshot with just a press of a key.
  + C:  Implemented .ZIP support.  Thanks to Jean-loup Gailly, Mark Adler,
    and Gilles Vollant for the ZIP routines!
  - Fixed a bug where pressing PageUp/PageDown in the cheat window
    went over by 3 entries.
  - Implemented longer cheat descriptions.  The cheat window and the
    .cht file format had to change a bit, however, ZSNES automatically
    converts any old formats to the new formats when it detects it.
  - Allowed the IRQ to be executed more than once on the same line
    through HIRQ.  Fixes the flickering problems of Doom/Offroad Baja.
  - NMI now executes at line 225 instead of 224.
  - Saving/Loading the state causing the control to stop or skip has
    been fixed again.
  + C:  .ZIP files can now be run from the commandline
  - Implemented an option for ZSNES to automatically save the save data
    approx. 5 seconds after it detects writes to it.  This will not
    work for SuperFX or SA-1 special chip games, however.  This option
    is disabled by default and can be enabled through the option window.
  - Implemented an option in the sound window to re-initialize the sound
    card after every 25-30 seconds.  Hopefully fixes the problems where
    the sound gets staticy after a certain amount of time.
  - Newest Save Slot will now appear as orange in the Save State
    Select (F3) window
  - Fixed a spc700 <-> 65816 sync bug during movie (.ZMV) playback
  - Implemented an option to enable Old Gfx Engine Mode 2 (Accessible
    through the options window in the GUI).  This mode fixes many
    transparency problems in 16bit modes, but can also create some
    and is also at times slower than the original engine.
  - Implemented 640x480x65536 VESA 1.2 support.  Currently supports
    Full Scanlines and Smallscreen modes.  However, it is strongly
    recommended that you only use VESA 1.2 support if your card cannot
    support VESA 2.0 (w/ linear framebuffer) since VESA 1.2 runs slower.
  - Implemented an option to disable Pitch Modulation
  - Sound card is now not re-initialized whenever a state is saved/loaded
    since some sound cards seems to have problems with it.
  - Implemented Single Windowing in the New Gfx 8bit engine, 8x8
    and 16x16 tile modes only
  - Fixed 64k SRAM support when loaded from the GUI
  - Optimised high resolution new gfx modes in 640x480x256
  - Fixed the graphic glitches in x488 snes vertical resolution modes
    in 640x480x256 new gfx mode
  - Optimised 640x480x256 Eagle Engine
  - Fixed the GUI background display bug in the new gfx engine
  - Fixed .SPC capture in the new gfx engine
  - Added an option to start with the newest save state when the game
    is loaded.  It can be enabled in Config->Options window in the GUI
  - Slightly optimised new gfx 8bit engine
  - Fixed several Mode 7 problems in the New Gfx 8bit engine
  - Changed DSP1 variables to use double instead of floats for a small
    speed increase.  Thanks to Gary Henderson for this tip!
  - Fixed up the Mode 7 slowdown bug when the scale ratio becomes small
    in most graphics modes
  - Optimised some Mode 7 transparency modes
  - Implemented EXTBG mode 7 into the newgfx 8bit engine
  - Fixed the 'FIX' feature in the cheat menu.  Seems like it wasn't
    writing any value to memory when it was clicked.
  - Game Genie codes are now defaulted to the 'FIX'ed mode.  Seems like
    most of the codes needs this.
  - Implemented windowing to Mode 7, New Gfx Engine 8bit
  - Added support for .SPC v0.2 format
  - Added an option in zsnes.cfg to disable configuration saving for
    those who want to store zsnes.exe in a read-only storage area
  - Fixed GameKeys display in the GUI for certain keys (such as the
    snes parallel adapter keys)
  - Implemented hi-res mode 7 (vertical expand only).  Currently only
    works in 640x480x256 newgfx engine (w/ Eagle and Scanlines disabled).
  - Fixed an offset per tile mode bug in the new gfx 8bit engine
  - Implemented dual windowing modes into the new gfx 8bit engine
  - New Gfx 8bit engine is now the default graphics engine in 256 color modes.
    It still lacks sprite windowing and also has some sprite flicker issues,
    but it's overall more stable, faster, and has more features.
    You can still switch back to the old gfx engine by pressing '8'.
  - Looks like Pitch Modulation was causing more sound problems than
    what it's worth.  It's now disabled by default, but you can reenable
    it through the GUI.
  - Added auto save/load state feature where ZSNES will automatically
    loads back the previous state when you last properly exited ZSNES.
    This feature is disabled by default.
  - Compressed the executable using UPX


............................................................

  - Fixed up a bug that prevented the gui to be disabled
  - Fixed up SPC capture
  - Fixed a bug when VIRQ is set on the same scanline as NMI
  - Implemented an automatic .IPS patcher.  Just rename your .IPS
    file to the rom filename with the .IPS extension and ZSNES will
    patch the rom realtime without modifying the rom file's contents.
    Thanks to Neill Corlett for most of the .IPS info!
  - Snapshot capture/skip 2 frames option now returns back to
    the proper menu item
  - Fixed a calibration bug with 6/8button joysticks
  - Fixed up display in 640x480x8 new gfx engine

  - Fixed up an ADSR bug for games that changes ADSR mid-sample
  - Fixed up echo emulation (possibly slowed down emulation)
  - Fixed up a sprite caching bug
  - Fixed up a DSP1 byte check stall bug
  - Implemented a commandline to disable spc700 speed hacks (-7)
    Might help with some compatibility
  - Implemented SA-1 support (most functions emulated)!  Unfortunately,
    it's still buggy.  Thanks to the snes9x team for providing info!
  - Fixed a bug when selecting drive A/B while a disk is not
    in the drive caused a long check sequence
  - Implemented Keyboard support to most of Option, Sound, and GUI Option
    configurations in the GUI
  - Changed sound init code a bit.  Hopefully improves sound card
    compatibility, but might also ruin it.
  - Implemented off by 1 line fix (-9).  This may help compatibility and
    fix some minor graphic glitches, but may also ruin some too.


............................................................
v0.715 - October 29, 1998
............................................................

  - Fixed a crashing bug when 16bit back window clipping was using
    an undefined windowing clip buffer
  - Added spc program counter check to the spc stall detection to
    reduce false alarms
  - Tweaked IRQ processing a bit
  - ZSNES.CFG and ZGUICFG.DAT are now fixed so that they will use
    the current directory when the SET CMDLINE detection fails
  - Fixed several mode 7 bugs in the new graphic engines
  - Implemented an option to save the configuration files in the MISC menu
  - Added a shadow to the in-game text displays
  - Fixed a bug created in v0.700 where pressing F3 while sound
    is disabled crashes zsnes
  - Fixed up player 4 and player 5 so they now work again
  - Fixed up color a bit in the old graphics 16bit engine
  - Added gamma control to 16bit old graphics engine
  - Fixed a cheat code bug where pressing the down key in the browser
    overflows by 3 rows
  - Fixed up a bug where any memory allocation below 48mbit support crashes
  - Added out of memory error when loading a file from the gui
  - Fixed a minor off by 1 pixel windowing bug
  + Fixed up memory requirements in the readme.txt.  It seems like
    compiling with C takes up 3.0 more megs.  It shouldn't though.
    An asm only version will be release later without dsp1/ipx support
    unless the reason is figured out.
  NOTE : It seems like IPX mode randomly loses packets in certain
         configurations so IPX isn't recommended to use yet.


............................................................
v0.700 - October 26, 1998
............................................................

  - Fixed another offset per tile mode bug

  - Implemented snapshot/increment by 2 frame feature in the F1 menu
    for those interested in producing animations
  - Added variable sound buffer size to reduce static in higher sampling rates
  - Changed method of reading the mouse cursor position in the GUI.
    Hopefully, this fixes those mouse crash problems when zsnes is
    run in pure dos and sometimes win95.
  - Added a commandline to disable palette 0 (back color) modification
    in 256 color modes
  - Implemented Turbo Buttons for buttons A,B,X, and Y.  Use the GUI to
    define those keys
  - Added the ability to toggle Turbo Change speed to 30hz instead of 60hz
    in the Options menu
  - Started C4 chip emulation.  Nothing is playable yet.
  - Fixed up SET CMDLINE detection.  Hopefully, zsnes.cfg and
    zguicfg.dat will now end up in the correct directory.
  - Started Modem Support (direct modem to modem).
    DOS-Compatible modem required!  Thanks to Dark Force for helping
    out on getting a bug that kept USR's and other modems from working!
    Also thanks to The Minder for a lot of help testing!
    Note : Modem mode isn't free of bugs
  - Added in-game chat key to the GUI keys for modem/net support.
    Currently defaulted to 't'
  - Forgot to add EMMS after any MMX routines that seems to cause
    any FPU instructions to crash
  - Fixed an interrupt re-enable bug in the Gamepad Pro code which
    seems to have eliminated the locking bugs when it's not set on GrIP mode

    Mike Gilroy, and Frank Hughes for a lot of help on this!
  - Several fixes to register 4211h
  - Rewrote IRQ timing handler (not perfect, but better)
  - Implemented Fossil Driver support to the modem support.
  - Fixed an IRQ reenable bug
  - Increased default cycles a bit
  - Fixed some major mode 7 rotation bugs
  - Added support for uninterleaved 48mbit roms
  - Added a FIX option to the cheat code to correct incorrectly converted codes
  - Implemented Mode 7 horizontal flip
  - Implemented primitive IPX support.  It is very primitive at
    the moment and may not work since it isn't really tested much.
  - Optimised some 65816 direct page addressing modes
  NOTE : .ZMV (Movie) files recorded under v0.635 has good potential
       on becoming obsolete in this version because of the timing changes
  NOTE : IPX support and Modem support may be buggy since it hasn't
       been tested on multiple types of connections yet.

............................................................
v0.625 - September 18, 1998
............................................................

  - Fixed up a major speed drop bug by just adding some empty space.
    Most likely a cache/alignment problem.

    crashes during compiling
  - Executable is now uncompressed.  It's 3 megs, but it provides a
    much faster start up time.

............................................................
v0.605 - September 10, 1998
............................................................

  - Fixed up a FPS display bug when switching between auto frame rate
    and manual frame rate in the GUI
  - Cheat Codes can now be toggled ON/OFF by double clicking on them
  - Tab key now switches from the Cheat Code enter box to the Description box
  - Fixed a Save State/Load State bug in the menu where it saved
    in the load directory instead of the save directory
  - Implemented 8button joystick support (Not tested)
  - Implemented an option in the .cfg file to enable reversed
    stereo sound (ReverseStereo)
  - Implemented an option in the .cfg file to share Player 1 and Player 2
    controls with Player 3 and Player 4's controls.  This option allows you to
    use 2 devices (Joystick and Keyboard) for both player 1 and player 2, but
    this also disables MultiTap support. (Pl34to12Share)
  - Added Reverse Stereo to the GUI under config/sound
  - Added Player 3, Player 4 to use as Player 1, Player 2 in the
    GUI under config/options

............................................................

  - Fixed up a sound card deinit bug that sometimes caused ZSNES to
    crash in certain sound cards
  - Disabled Autoinit mode when a low sampling rate is used in 8bit
    sound.  Probabily was also causing problems in some cards

  Note : The offset per tile mode in the 16bit oldgfx engine seems to randomly
    crash sometimes for an unknown reason.  If 16bit mode crashes for you and
    8bit doesn't, press the '0' key in 16bit mode to disable that mode.

v0.600 - September 9, 1998
............................................................

  *** ADDED A NEW MEMBER TO THE ZSNES TEAM! ***
  Welcome Pharos to the team, his role is currently a coding assitant.
  So far, he helped us objectize the zsnes source code which greatly
  helped in the compile time, provided assembly help, and helped us
  prepare on linking C code to zsnes (not completely there yet).

  Note : It is strongly recommended to not use the 16-bit new
         graphics engine yet because of bugs and speed concerns.  It
         is enabled only in 320x240x65536 for those who are interested.

  - Added partial 65816 execution in the DMA registers (doesn't seem to
    fix mucht due to some other problem) Thanks to Alucard for this info!
    This also slowed down emulation a bit.
  - Implemented sprite priority correction into the new graphics engine
  - Implemented mosaic into the new graphics engine
  - Implemented true 512 horizontal resolution into new graphics engine
    (both 16x8 and 16x16 tile modes)
  - Implemented interlaced 448 vertical resolution into new graphics engine
  - Implemented offset per tile mode into the new graphics engine
    (Mode 2/Vertical only).  More accurate compared to the old graphics engine.
    (seems to be a bug where the game gets very slow sometimes though)
  - Started 16-bit new graphics engine
  - Implemented sprite priority correction in 16bit new gfx engine
  - Implemented palette raster effects in 16bit new gfx engine
  - Fixed a minor bg enable/disable bug in the new gfx engine
  - Multiple SPC700 bug fixes.  More games run now!
  - Implemented SPCPlay sound engine into zsnes :
      - Echo & FIR Filter Support (Slowed down emulation, but gives
        better sound)  Thanks to feenix65 for info on FIR Filter!
      - Volume fixes
      - Rewrote ADSR/GAIN engine
      - Added Adjustable Volume through the commandline and zsnes.cfg
      - 16000 and 32000 extra sampling rates

  - Fixed an old style joystick read bug that prevented the joypad
    from functioning in certain games
  - Several optimisations on Echo & FIR Filter
  - Several Sound DSP Fixes
  - Temporarily fixed a V-latch bug in some games that don't update the
    display at every frame
  - Add/Removed some game hacks for compatibility
  - Modified Song Start Search in .spc capture.  Should be much better now.
  - Fixed a sprite window clipping bug where it was used when it's not
    supposed to be.
  - Modified memory allocation technique in zsnes.  This should now
    eliminate some random crash errors.  Thanks to Y0SHi for this info!
  - -c now does full screen instead of small screen in 640x480 modes.
    For small screen, use -cc
  - Fixed a back area 1/2 addition bug which caused the background
    to be sometimes darker than usual
  - Fixed a mode 7 transparency bug
  - Added 8-bit stereo sound and 8-bit sound high speed mode support
    (high speed mode support is just the implementation of 8bit 44100khz
     or 22050khz stereo)  Thanks to Crono for a lot of help on this!
  - Fixed up sound blaster deinit code
    Thanks again to Crono!
  - Wrote an entirely new GUI :
      - Mouse driven GUI/Menu Based
      - Full Keyboard Support in all the Quick (Arrow Menu), Load,
        and Cheat menu items
      - Ability to display load names under 8.3 filename format, snes
        header name, and win95 long filenames
      - Support for Save State, Load State, and Select State through menu items
      - Quick Load Menu (Arrow menu) which allows you to quickly load
        the last 10 games loaded
      - Ability to Freeze or Clear the Quick Load Menu
      - An Options menu which allows you to configure settings such
        as video mode, sound settings, frame skip, etc.
      - Added the ability to customize the game keys such as
        the save state key, misc toggles, etc.
      - Ability to use those keys as joystick buttons
      - Customizeable background palette displacement
      - Several minor GUI customization features
      - Ability to quickly exit/enter the GUI with the right
        mouse button (Disabled by default)

        Finger Cheat Codes
      - Ability to browse the cheat codes and Toggle or Remove the codes
      - Ability to Save/Load Cheat Codes (saves them as .CHT files
        in the same directory as the .SRM/.ZST files)
      - Ability to Select Input Devices for each joypad
      - Ability to Define Keys/Button configuration for each joypad

        But they are NOT implemented in zsnes yet.
  - Fixed a bug when clearing the screen in 640x480x65536
  - Implemented full add, half add, full subtract, and
    half subtract into the new 16bit graphics engine
    Not sure why, but some transparency modes are actually slower
    than the old engine.  Most likely flushing the cache a lot somewhere.
  - Implemented background transparencies into new 16bit graphics engine
    (implemented incorrectly at the moment.  Some transparency modes also is
    slower than the old graphics engine, but that will change in the future)
  - Implemented fixed color transparencies (very incorrect because of
    lack of windowing)
  - Fixed a minor bug in the fast forward routines
  - Rewrote most of the 65816 speed hack.  It should now be a lot more
    friendly with games (reduced graphic glitches/increased compatibility).
  - Fixed a bug in Mode7 with Windowing and Transparency enabled
  - Allowed 16bit HDMA sound blaster values less than 5 to be used.
    Not exactly sure if this works though.
  - Implemented Mouse Disable Command Line (-j)
  - Rewrote Input Device Routines (Keyboard, Joystick, SNES Mouse,
    and Super Scope Handlers)
  - Added GamePad Pro Support (Don't know if it works on a standard
    GrIP system though).  Thanks to Marius Fodor for the code!
  - Added Snes Parallel Port Support for both LPT1 and LPT2.
    Thanks to Karl for the code!
  - Added MultiTap (Multiplayer 5) Support!  (Only up to 4 players
    at the moment though)

  - Fixed an overflow caching bug in the new gfx engine where a few games
    run very slow
  - Added some C -> ASM converted DSP1 functions.  Some functions
    were unable to convert properly so no DSP1 games are playable
    until the actual C code is in
  - Executable is now compressed using epack
  - Implemented sprite transparency into the 16-bit new graphics engine
  - Implemented mode7 transparency into the 16-bit new graphics engine
  - Higher memory requirements (Sorry, but this is unavoidable as long
    as ZSNES keeps expanding)
  - Implemented Echo Disable in the zsnes.cfg for those who want some
    extra speed in return for lost sound quality
  - A bunch of other fixes that we forgot to list


............................................................

    In case autodetect fails, use -i.  Thanks to feenix65 for this info!
  - Improved header detection.  Should now work better with demos
    and games with weird filesizes
  - Added a new graphics engine in 256 color mode.  It should be much faster
    in areas that don't use mode 7, but lacks a lot of features such as
    windowing, mosaic, and sprite priorities so it is disabled by default.
    It can be enabled by pressing 8 during gameplay.  (~40-100% faster)
  - Optimised Mode 7 in 256 color mode
  - Implemented dual windowing to color window clipping
  - Fixed several color window clipping bugs
  - Added full resolution screenshot capture in 640x480x65536 mode
    To activate while in that mode, hold backspace and press F1

    is enabled at start
  - Added CopyMethod to zsnes.cfg which can default the copy method
    as either fpu copy or mmx copy
  - Allowed systems with 5.5MB of RAM free to load 2mbit roms
  - Fixed sidewinder support when sound is set at a high sampling rate.
    Thanks to Marius Fodor for the source!

  - Fixed another sprite clipping bug
  - Fixed clipping in Mode7 16-bit mode
  - Removed FPU Copy since it didn't seem to speed up emulation
  - Added .USA and .JAP rom extension into the GUI
  - Added Save SPC Data which saves the contents of the SPC700/DSP
    of the beginning of the next song (Future Reserved)
  - Add Sound Buffer Dump which dumps the decompressed sound buffer as raw pcm.
    This can become quite inaccurate due to the way how zsnes stores its
    decompressed sounds.
  - Added MenuItem Sound Buffer Dump into the F1 Menu
  - Added MenuItem Save SPC Data into the F1 Menu
  - Added a key to disable offset mode.  Press 0 key to activate/deactivate
  - Added small screen support in 640x480VESA2 modes.  This mode should be much
    faster for those who use 640x480.  Use the -c commandline to enable this
    when in 640x480.
  - Added an option for centered small screen.  Use the -cc commandline.
  - Fixed up 320x240x65536 support for ARGB cards again.

  - Added Dual Windowing on BGs in all logic modes
  - Added Dual Windowing on Sprites
  - Added some minor stuff to the header displayer
  - Added partial offset per tile mode. (Mode 2/Vertical/8x8)

v0.270 - December 25, 1997
............................................................

  - Properly cleared memory when loaded off of the GUI
  - Implemented realtime adsr/gain switch.  Special thanks to Sardu for
    help on this!

  - Fixed a SRAM Memory Map Bug
  - Fixed a bug in old style joystick read
  - Disabled sram save using tilde key.  Instead, enter/exit the GUI since
    it also saves the sram.
  - Added panic key which turns back on all sound channels and backgrounds.
    Press 6 to activate this.
  - Added snes mouse support!  Use 7 to switch between keyboard and mouse.

  - GUI now doesn't enter load when no files are found.
    Thanks to ScanT for reporting this!
  - Sped up execution loop a bit

    should work better now.


............................................................
v0.200 - November 4, 1997
............................................................

  - Reg$2137 was calculating the horizontal position incorrectly
  - Fixed up a looping bug in sound DSP.  Thanks to EFX for some help on this!
  - Added Key to dump SRAM to Harddisk (tilde key, ~) during game
  - Fixed up gain sound effects
  - Fixed a couple of SPC timer bugs
  - Added Stereo Sound!  (Use -Z)
  - Added some precision to the DSP (this seemed to have slowed emulation down)
  - Changed Real Time State Save Format.  However, ZSNES will automatically
    convert from an older format.  Some problems may come up because of the
    many changes in the dsp.
  - Fixed up a sprite ordering bug.  Thanks to Y0SHi!
  - Added Scanlines (Use -N)  Only available for 256x256/640x480x65536
  - Adjusted SPC timers
  - Fixed up BG Mode 0 display
  - Fixed up a bug that crashes when hirom sram is accessed
  - Fixed up a VIRQ bug
  - Added a simple, yet effective dsp timer wait substitute.  Seems to make many
    games run much faster with sound!
  - Fixed VRAM increment bug.  Special thanks to Trepalium for this info!
  - Fixed up multiple SPC bugs
  - Player 2 was still reading the joystick even though keyboard was selected.
    This is now fixed.
  - Added VSync (-w).  Thanks to Marius Fodor for the code!
    Please use -f 0 when using this.
  - Added a very simple GUI.  Currently, it only loads, reset, and quit.
    Also, load cannot change the current directory.
  - Added -m to disable the GUI
  - Added Stereo to zsnes.cfg.  Add this if you want to enable stereo :
      Stereo = 1


............................................................
v0.182 - October 23, 1997
............................................................

  - Small fix to a priority in bg4 drawing
  - Added TCALL and PCALL
     Special Thanks to Gary of Snes9X!
  - Enabled the debugger (use the -d command line)


............................................................
v0.180 - October 22, 1997
............................................................

  - Move the whats new stuff to readme.txt
  - Forgot to remove the end of string marker so the new vesa modes didn't show
    in the previous version help
  - Fixed minor SNES PPU DMA bug
  - lowered volume again
  - Fixed a vesa 2 bug issue.  Nothing major
  - Removed PCALL/TCALL.  If anyone knows the implementation of these
    instructions, please tell us.  Also, we will not accept any requests to put
    these back on unless the info the found.  Thanks.
  - Modified SPC700 cycle timing.
  - Added code that properly deinits sound blaster auto-init mode
  - Moved sound blaster interrupt code a bit
  - Added Gamma Correction (use -g # in the command line)
  - Added what the default keys are in the readme.txt (We should have done this
    in the first release.  Oh well =) )
  - Added a new command line that can modify the % of clock cycles executed.
    ZSNES currently is modified so that 100% runs as many games as possible so
    it is strongly recommended that you do not set this.  But to modify this,
    use -p # in the command line.
  - Hopefully fixed up sprite BG layering priorities and background priorities
    to the correct way.  Thanks to Y0SHi for this info!
  - Fixed up key ordering in zsnes.cfg.  Thanks to Michael and Aquis for
    reporting this!  If zsnes.cfg already exists, change the button order to :
    B, Y, A, X, L, R
  - Fixed up set blaster detection.
  - SPC700 : Fixed up a minor flag setting bug in pop psw


............................................................
v0.170 - October 16, 1997
............................................................

  - Fixed crashing bug when 8000Hz sound is selected (divide by 0 problem)
  - Forgot to add code to support Sound Blaster irqs greater than 7
  - Changed 65816 timing a bit. (should help compatibility a bit)
  - Fixed a bug in 65816 stack routines.
    Special Thanks to Alucard for reporting this!
  - Somewhat modified sound decompression routines
  - Somewhat sped up Mode 7
  - Fixed a minor screen add/sub bug in non-repeating mode 7
  - Added increment by 8 vram access registers
  - Video Modes should now clear the screen when init
  - ZSNES now automatically creates a default .cfg file when one is missing
  - Forgot to implement save/load state messages in 16-bit.  It's there now.
  - Added a new command line : -b.  This disables sound compression buffering.
    There is a noticeable slowdown, but this should reduce static.
  - Added sound compression buffering disable in the .cfg file
    If you have an old .cfg file already, manually add this string at
    the end if you want to disable sound buffering :  SoundBufDisable = 1
  - Added 640x480 modes for both 8 and 16 bit.  VESA2 is still required and
    these modes are much slower too.  This seems to still not work on various
    video cards.  There's probabily a bug in VESA2 detection.
  - Fixed a sprite layering bug.
  - Reduced sound volume to prevent overflows.  This seems to make the sound
    better, but the pitch calculations are still incorrect due to SPC bugs.
  - Fixed a screen sub bug.  Thanks to Barubary!
