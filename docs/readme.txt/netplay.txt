Netplay has been disabled for the indefinite future, until the core becomes more
accurate and/or non-random. We recommend using ZSNES v1.36 or v1.42n
[http://nsrt.edgeemu.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=448] until this is resolved.

The Netplay dialog is only accessible if a game is loaded.


............................................................
  1.                   Things To Know
............................................................

    - ZSNES currently limits Netplay to two computers. Up to five players can
      still play, however (by having more than one player at either of the two
      computers).
    - A game must be on each computer in order to have it available for Netplay.
    - You cannot use cheat codes, key combinations, or turbo keys in Netplay.


............................................................
  2.     System Recommendations for Smooth Netplay
............................................................

    - Both users must use the *same version* of ZSNES (e.g. Both users should be
      using v1.36).
    - Both users should be using reasonably fast computers (about 800mhz). If
      one user has a slow computer (e.g. 200mhz) while the other has a fast one,
      the slow computer's low framerate will bog down the fast computer, causing
      poor framerates on the fast computer.
    - Both users should be using the same setting for sound (either enabled or
      disabled; see the Config-->Sound menu in the GUI or the ZSNES
      configuration file).
    - Back Buffer must be enabled and the latency value must be 3 or 2 (reduce
      it to 2 for fast-paced platform games).
    - The games have to run at least 50 FPS on BOTH computers without Netplay.
      This can completely depend on factors such as CPU, video card, video mode,
      and the game you are running. (See System Requirements [Readme.txt]).
    - Both users must use the same protocol setting (either UDP or TCP). If both
      players are on the same LAN, you should use UDP (it has lower overhead).
      Otherwise, use TCP (no packet loss).
    - You will also need an Internet connection with ping times of less than
      400ms between both connections. The higher than ping time, the worse the
      Netplay experience, since ping times measure the time it takes for data to
      get to the other side and back. You can expect a not-so-great performance
      if you have a ping time of 400 or greater.


............................................................
  3.                Simple Instructions
............................................................

    1. Go to Netplay -> Internet.
    2. Decide who will be the server and who will be the client.
       (Neither has the gameplay advantage since ZSNES treats both the same
       after a connection is established).
    3. If you are the server, send the IP that is shown on the connection window
       to your friend (e.g. through any chat program (ICQ, AIM, IRC, etc.)).
       Then click on 'Start Server'.
    4. If you are the client, type in the IP address that your friend has given
       you and then click on 'Connect to Server'.
    5. Chat with your friend on what game to play.
    6. Once decided, make sure that the filename on both sides are the same and
       that the load window points to the directory where the filename is.
    7. Load the game.
    8. Have fun! (If it worked)
    9. If it said 'Checksum Mismatch', try uncompressing the file if it is
       compressed. If not, then both sides have a different version of that ROM
       (e.g. One side has the Japanese version while the other has the English,
       or both versions are English, but are different version releases of the
       same game).
   10. If you want to chat in-game, press 'T' and type in your line. You can
       change this key in the Misc -> Misc Keys options from the GUI.


............................................................
  4.                   Loading a Game
............................................................

Once successfully connected, the chat window should open up.

From there, you can load a game as you normally would. But in order to load a
game, both sides must have their load window pointing to the directory where
the game is located and also have identical filenames for the game. Only one
side has to load the game; after that, the other side will automatically load
the game without the user's interaction.

If an error pops up saying 'ROM data mismatch', then it means that either side
has a different version of the ROM. This sometimes happens with compressed files
even when both files are the same, so it is recommended that you uncompress the
games and try again if this error occurs.


............................................................
  5.                Configuring Options
............................................................

The default settings are recommended.

However, if your computer is slower than 266 MHz, then it is recommended that
both sides play with back buffer disabled. Note that disabling this will degrade
controller response.

You can increase the latency value if the average ping time between both
connections is high (you can tell if the gameplay runs too jerky).

Reducing the latency value when back buffer is enabled will improve controller
response time. However, this will cause the remote player to jump around more
in order to keep both sides in sync.

For controller options (PL1, PL2, PL3,..), the first checkmarked player would be
using Input #1 of the local side. The second checkmarked player would be using
Input #2 and so on. Players marked with an 'X' are checkmarked on the remote
side.

  6.                  Troubleshooting
............................................................

    - If you are the client, and it failed to connect, check to make sure that
      the IP you entered is correct and that you are properly connected to the
      Internet.
    - If you are the server, and the IP provided in the connection window
      doesn't seem to be the correct one, you can visit
      [http://www.whatismyipaddress.com] to determine the correct one. Then tell
      your client what it is so he or she can connect. Alternatively, if you're
      using mIRC, just type /dns <nick>.
    - If the client says 'Found Client' and nothing else happens, chances are
      that your net connection does not support UDP. If this is the case, both
      sides will need to deselect 'Use UDP Instead of TCP'. However, it is
      strongly recommended that you use UDP if possible since it is much faster
      than TCP.
    - If you have Windows 95 and you are getting a init failed error, you should
      download and install the Winsock 2.0 update for Windows 95:
      [http://www.microsoft.com/Windows95/downloads/contents/WUAdminTools
        /S_WUNetworkingTools/W95Sockets2/Default.asp].
      Warning: Do not install this if you do not have Windows 95.
    - You may need to disable your firewall (or just disable it for UDP port
      7845) in order to get the UDP protocol that ZSNES's Netplay uses to work.
    - Internet Connection Sharing users (Win9x systems) may need to download an
      ICS Configuration utility to get the connection to work and map UDP port
      7845. You can use "ICS Configuration", found here:
      [http://www.practicallynetworked.com/sharing/ics/icsconfiguration.htm].
    - If you need help forwarding your router port, you may refer to AntoineWG's
      Router Port Forwarding Guide. You should be able to find this guide at the
      ZSNES board [http://board.zsnes.com].
    - Tips for reducing general slowdown can be found under "Why is ZSNES slow?"
      in the Speed section of the FAQ page [FAQ.txt].
