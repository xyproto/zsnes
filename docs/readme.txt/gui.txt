ZSNES uses a custom GUI, introduced in v0.600.

You can move the ZSNES window either by clicking and dragging its title bar, or
right-clicking anywhere in the ZSNES window and dragging. You can move dialogs
within ZSNES by clicking and dragging their respective title bars.

If any dialog is open within ZSNES, pressing ESC will close the top-most window.

If a game is loaded and running, you can press ESC to pause emulation and show
the GUI. Pressing ESC again will hide the GUI and resume emulation.

Certain options throughout the GUI have an associated hotkey. Notice that many
options have a letter in them that is underlined; pressing that letter on your
keyboard will toggle the option.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  This opens the file loading dialog. Use this dialog to browse for a ROM to
  load and begin emulation.

  Filename box - Displays files in the current directory in alphabetical order.
    Double-click on a file to load it. Use the Show All Extensions option to
    change what types of files are displayed in this box.
  Directory box - Displays all subdirectories in the current directory.
    Double-click on items in this box to navigate between folders. The first
    item in this box is always two dots (..); double-click this item to move
    to the parent directory of the current directory. Displayed below the
    current subdirectories are all drive letters detected on your system.
    Use these drive letters to change between drives.
  Current directory - Below these two boxes, the current directory is displayed.
    By default, the current directory will be the same directory in which the
    ZSNES executable is located.
  Address box - By typing letters into this box, you can go to the first
    filename or directory that matches the string of letters you typed.
  Current selection - Below the text box, the current / highlighted
    selection is displayed. In the DOS port, this line does not display the
    current selection, but instead says "Display Type:".
  Display Type: - Choose what type of filename to display in the Filename box.
      Long Filename (Win/SDL) or Win9x Long Filename (DOS) displays the actual
        name of the files in the current directory, along with their extensions.
      SNES Header Name will display the internal SNES header names of the files
        in the current directory.
          * ZSNES can display header names using English and Kanji
            characters. Characters in other languages are not supported and
            will be displayed as garbled text. Improper or invalid header
            names will also be garbled text.
          * The header names of compressed files will not be displayed.
          * If for some reason the header of a file cannot be displayed, the
            filename of that file will instead be displayed.
          * Warning: Using this option can make navigating folders a slow
            process, since each time you navigate to a new folder, ZSNES
            must scan all files in the folder for their header names.
      DOS 8.3 Format (DOS only, default for DOS) will truncate all filenames
        to be compatible with DOS filename length restrictions (up to eight
        letters in the filename, plus a three letter extension).
  Show All Extensions (off by default) - When this option is not checked,
    only files with common SNES ROM extensions (.smc, .sfc, ...) will be
    displayed. When this option is checked, all files will be displayed,
    regardless of extension. When used in combination with the SNES Header Name
    option above, non-ROM files will be shown as ** Invalid File **.
  Force - Checking these boxes will force ROMs to be loaded as if they had those
    settings, rather than having ZSNES automatically detect those settings.
    Don't check any of these boxes unless you know what you're doing.
      * NTSC / PAL: Force one of these display types for all ROMs loaded.
      * HiROM / LoROM: Force one of these memory mapping settings for all ROMs
          loaded.
  Load button will load the current selection and begin emulation.

  Keyboard usage with the file load dialog is as follows:
      Left / Right Arrows - Switch between the file and directory boxes.
      Up / Down Arrows - Move up and down in the list.
      PageUp / PageDown - Move up and down the list in larger increments.
      Home / End - Go to the top or bottom of the list.
      Typing characters - Go to the first item in the list that matches the
        typed characters.
      Enter / Return - Load the currently selected file or open the
        currently selected folder.

  Address box details:
      * If you input a single space, ZSNES will *randomly* select a game or
        folder within the current directory, depending on which box is
        highlighted. Then hit Load or press Enter to open the selection.
      * When you press enter with text in the box without any '\' or ':' in
        the filename, ZSNES will first look for a directory matching the text
        and will then change its directory if one is found. Otherwise, it will
        load the current file or directory highlighted by the selection cursor.
      * You can type in the full filename or directory including path (e.g.
        "d:\games\mario.smc" or just "d:").

  This dialog allows you to customize the input options for all five SNES
  controllers.

  Tabs #1-#5 - Choose the SNES controller to configure. You can use the Tab key
    to cycle through these tabs.
  Device: - Use your mouse to choose your desired device, and use the Set button
    to set your choice.
        None - Equivalent to unplugging the SNES controller from that port.
        Keyboard/Gamepad (Win/SDL only) - Equivalent to plugging in the SNES
          controller to that port. Using this device should allow input from
          all attached keyboards, gamepads and joysticks.
        If you are using the DOS port, you must manually choose the appropriate
          device from the list.
  Current: - Shows the device that is currently active.
  Buttons
      Set - Set your choice made in the Device: box. Using this button will
        reset key assignments to their defaults.
      Set Keys - ZSNES will automatically cycle through each of the standard
        SNES buttons, prompting you to assign a key to each one.
      Calibrate (DOS only) - This option is here for those older joysticks that
        need to be calibrated in-game before they can be used properly.
  Keys: - These are the standard SNES buttons, and the only ones required to
    be configured. Click inside the black box beside each one of these to
    configure a key for it. Press ESC to clear the current assignment.
  Turbo: - You can assign keys to these buttons in the same way you assign
    them to the standard SNES buttons. Holding down the key assigned to the
    turbo button is the same as if you were repeatedly pressing the normal
    button very, very fast. You can control the rate of key presses per second
    with the "Turbo at 30Hz" option, below.
  Diagonals: - It may be more convenient to assign a single key to a
    diagonal direction of the D-Pad, rather than pressing two keys at the
    same time. Just in case it's not obvious: DL=Down+Left, DR=Down+Right,
    UL=Up+Left, UR=Up+Right.
  Game Specific - This option allows for input configurations that are specific
    to individual games.
  Sidewinder Fix (DOS port only) - If your Sidewinder doesn't work after
    disabling the Sidewinder profiler and having pressed the mode button twice,
    enable this.
  Allow U+D/L+R - This option allows for the simultaneous pressing of opposing
    directional keys (up and down; left and right) on the SNES pad. This feature
    was implemented for those who need it to exploit bugs in certain games for
    recording "speed-run" ZMVs. Warning: Do not use this for normal gameplay,
    as the resulting bugs disrupt the "natural" gaming experience.
  Turbo at 30Hz - Default: Checked. When enabled, turbo keys will equal 30
    button presses per second in NTSC games or 25 presses per second in PAL
    games. Otherwise, turbo keys will repeat 60 times per second in NTSC games
    or 50 times per second in PAL games. This option is enabled by default
    mainly because some games can't handle excessive key presses.
  Use Pl3/4 as Pl1/2 - The key assignments for Player 3, in addition to
    those for Player 1, will be used for SNES controller port #1. The key
    assignments for Player 4, in addition to those for Player 2, will be
    used for SNES controller port #2. As a result, MultiTap support will be
    disabled (which means only two controllers will be active). The primary
    use of this option is to allow you to assign two different devices for
    the same SNES controller. For example, you might use a gamepad as input
    for Player 1, and a keyboard as input for Player 3. Then, with this
    option enabled, you may use either one of these devices (or both
    simultaneously) to control Player 1.
  Use Joystick Port 209H (DOS only) - Use the 209H hardware port; use this
    if you have moved the port's jumper (or if your joystick does not work
    when this feature is disabled).

  Note: A keyboard is a poor replacement for a proper gamepad. SNES games are
    designed to be played with a gamepad, so if you find that you're having
    trouble with the keyboard, use a gamepad.

  There is another important limitation with keyboards. Many keyboards have
  a limit on the maximum number of simultaneous key-presses, above which they
  will not detect input. This means combinations of, for example, three or
  more keys may not be properly detected. One way to get around this kind
  of keyboard limitation is to assign multiple SNES buttons to the same
  keyboard key. There is a slightly longer explanation in the FAQ [FAQ.txt].

  This dialog allows you to select special input devices for Ports 1 and 2
  of the SNES.

  Port 1: - Select a device to be plugged into Port 1. The SNES Mouse is the
    only special device supported on Port 1.
        Gamepad - Use the key assignments for Player #1, configured in the
          Input dialog.
        Mouse - Use your computer's mouse just like it is a connected SNES
          Mouse.
  Port 2: - Select a device to be plugged into Port 2.
        Gamepad - Use the key assignments for Player #2, configured in the
          Input dialog.
        Mouse - Use your computer's mouse just like it is a connected SNES
          Mouse.
        Super Scope - Use your mouse as if it were a Super Scope. Default
          key assignments are in the Default Keys section [Readme.txt].
        1 Justifier - Simulates the movements for the Konami Justifier;
          required for only one game, Lethal Enforcers.
        2 Justifiers -
  Cycle P1:, Cycle P2: - You can assign a key to each of these functions.
    Pressing the key will cycle through the list of special controllers
    available for that port.
  Left Handed - Check one of these boxes to reverse the mouse buttons for the
    special controllers on that port.
  Super Scope Keys: - They can now be customized!
        Auto-Fire - Default: =. Toggle auto-fire on or off.
        SS Pause - Default: Backspace. Assign a key for the Super Scope pause
          button.

  Note: ZSNES will automatically enable the appropriate add-on for special
    controller games that have NSRT headers [http://nsrt.edgeemu.com] (e.g.
    The SNES mouse will automatically hook up after loading Mario Paint).
  Note: ZSNES supports the ManyMouse [http://icculus.org/manymouse/] library
    by Ryan C. Gordon, which means that ZSNES can emulate two SNES devices
    (one connected in each port) if you have two mice plugged in. For a list
    of known affected games (and for other information), please see the
    ManyMouse section of the Games page [Games.txt].

  You can change various options here, some of which affect gameplay,
  while others merely change GUI behavior.

  System:
      Enable MMX Support - Enables MMX copying routines for a slight speed
        increase (MMX processors only). Certain video filters, audio
        interpolation and low-pass filters require MMX support. These options
        will not be visible unless the MMX Support option is checked.
        (See below for the particular options requiring MMX support).
      Pause Emu in Background (Win only) - If enabled, then game emulation
        will automatically be paused when the ZSNES window loses focus, and it
        will unpause when ZSNES regains focus.
      Increase Emu Priority (Win only) - Enabling this will give ZSNES more
        processor time, if needed. This may improve the performance of ZSNES on
        your machine; however, it will reduce the amount of resources given to
        applications running in the background. Processing priority is set to
        "High" on a Win9x OS and "Above Normal" on 2k/XP/2003/Vista.
      Disable Power Management (Win only) - Disables power management while
        ZSNES is running, so that your gameplay will not be interrupted if
        you're using a gamepad.
  Gfx Engines:
      Use New Gfx Eng - Default: Checked. Check to use the new graphics engine;
        uncheck to use the old graphics engine. The new graphics engine should
        be adequate for most games; however, the old one may be necessary for
        some. You can read about the differences in Current Progress
        [Readme.txt].
      Use Alt Old Gfx Eng - Only visible when the new graphics engine is
        disabled, this will enable the Old Gfx Engine Mode 2, which fixes many
        transparency bugs that currently plague ZSNES in the current engine.
        However, it also creates some new ones. This mode can be slower at
        times, so it's recommended that you only turn it on when you need it.
  SShots: - Choose what image format to use for snapshots of the game screen.
    This setting is also configurable via the F1 Menu.
      * BMP - Snapshots will be saved as bitmap pictures (16-bit color). If you
          are using an 8-bit video mode in the DOS port, the bitmap will be
          saved with 8-bit color.
      * PNG - Snapshots will be saved as PNG ("Portable Network Graphics") files
          (32-bit ARGB color). This option is not available if you did not
          compile with PNG support.
  ROM:
      Enable IPS Auto-Patching - When checked, ZSNES will automatically
        soft patch ROMs if a corresponding .ips file is found in your Saves
        directory. More information about the IPS patching feature can be found
        in the Readme.
      Show ROM Info on Load - Briefly displays some internal information about
        the ROM when loaded. Please refer to this information when submitting
        bug reports (also see [Support.txt]).
      Log ROM Info - When checked, ZSNES will create a file named rominfo.txt
        when you load a ROM; it contains information about the ROM.
  Overlays:
      Show FPS Cntr On Emu Load - When checked, the Frames per Second counter
        will be enabled each time you start ZSNES, even if it has been disabled
        during a session. The FPS counter can be manually enabled/disabled via
        the F1 Menu or with the 'Display FPS' quick key, once it has been
        assigned. This counter is only visible when using Auto Frame Rate.
      Show Clock - The current system time will be displayed in the lower
        right-hand corner of the game screen.
            12 Hour Mode - Used in conjunction with the option above, this will
              display the system time in 12 hour mode instead of the default 24
              hour mode.
            Show Clock Box - Also used in conjunction with "Enable Clock",
              this option places a black box behind the clock to increase
              readability.
  Messages:
      Use Small Message Text - On-screen messages that pop up when you save a
        state, disable a background, etc. will be smaller.
      Use Transparent Text - On-screen messages will be slightly transparent
        rather than solid. Using the Small Message Text option overrides this
        choice.

  Please note that the internal resolution of the SNES is 256x224. Certain
  special high-resolution modes can produce up to 512x448 resolution. You
  may notice that the internal resolution has an 8:7 aspect ratio. SNES
  video output is not intended to be viewed at this aspect ratio, however.
  The 8:7 video signal would normally be scaled to a more-typical 4:3

    You can use your mouse or the Up/Down/PgUp/PgDown/Home/End keys to scroll
    through this list.
      Win/SDL port:
          First column: lists the resolution, in pixels, W x H.
              W x H - These video modes use a fixed resolution, in pixels,
                of the width and height shown.
              Variable (SDL only) - Video output is scaled to the size of the
                window, and the window can be resized with the mouse; however,
                aspect ratio is locked, depending on which options are set.
              Custom - Specify a custom, fixed resolution in the boxes
                to the right.
          Second column:
              O (SDL only) - Indicates whether the video mode uses the
                OpenGL API.
              D - The video mode supports graphics-enhancing filters.
                Non-'D' modes will usually be (automatically) interpolated
                by your graphics card.
              R - The video aspect ratio is locked to the internal SNES
                ratio of 8:7.
              S - Video output is stretched to fill the entire window.
          Third column: indicates whether the video mode is Windowed or
            Fullscreen.
      DOS port:
          First column: lists the resolution (in pixels) and color depth
            (in bits), W x H x B.
          Second column: shows the mode type
              ModeQ - A tweaked VGA video mode. Supports 256x256 resolution
                and 256 colors. Accesses hardware directly.
              ModeX - A different tweaked VGA video mode, similar to ModeQ,
                although slower. Accesses hardware directly.
              Vesa1 - VESA ("Video Electronic Standards Association") VBE
                ("Video BIOS Extension") 1.2. A standardized method of
                accessing VGA cards.
              Vesa2 - VESA VBE 2. Faster and more features than VESA1.
                Read the Wikipedia article for an overview
                [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_BIOS_Extensions].
                The first [http://www.ddj.com/184409592] and third
                [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/pc-hardware-faq/supervga-programming/]
                external links from that article provide some more detailed
                information.
      Your video card may be compatible with only some of the video modes
        listed. You should try each video mode to find the right combination
        of speed, compatibility, and enhancement features (listed below).
  Set button - use the currently selected/highlighted video mode. ZSNES will now
    attempt to change to the new video mode. If the new video mode does not
    work, wait for ten seconds without pressing any keys, and ZSNES will return
    to the previous mode. Pressing Enter does the same thing as the Set button.
  Custom: (Win/SDL only) - use in conjunction with one of the custom
    video modes at the bottom of the list to set a custom resolution.
        Set button - save the current custom resolution.
        Type in the custom width and height, respectively, in pixels,
          in the two black boxes.
  Current: - shows the current video mode.

  Note: Some video modes may work better / faster than others, depending
    on your system configuration. Play around to see what's best.

  Video Filters: - Choose one video filter. You must use a D video mode
    to use any of these filters. Furthermore, filters marked with a *
    require MMX Support.
      Interpolation - Enable interpolation, a simple filter that smooths the
        image and makes it appear less pixellated. This is software-driven and
        can be accelerated with MMX support.
      Bilinear Filter [http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/Bilinear_Filtering]
        (OpenGL modes only) - This produces an effect similar to Interpolation.
        The option replaces Interpolation and, as long as you aren't using Mesa
        [http://www.mesa3d.org], is hardware-driven. This means that as long as
        you aren't using Mesa, it requires less CPU overhead. Another advantage
        of the bilinear filter is that it can also be used alongside the other
        filters, though this may be slow.
      NTSC [http://www.slack.net/~ant/libs/ntsc.html] (Win/SDL only) -
        Written by blargg. It is recommended to use a video mode with at least
        602x448 resolution. Makes the video output appear to be that of an NTSC
        CRT [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube] television
        [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ntsc]. This filter is not available
        in the SDL port while using OpenGL modes.
      2xSaI Engine* [http://elektron.its.tudelft.nl/~dalikifa/] - Written by
        Kreed. SaI stands for "Scale and Interpolation." This is a "smart"
        filter that tries to make a lo-res image (like SNES video output)
        appear to have a higher resolution. The image should look smoother,
        less blocky, when using this filter.
      Super Eagle* - Written by Kreed. Similar to the 2XSaI engine, but
        does more blending.
      Super 2xSaI* - Written by Kreed. This filter smoothes the graphics,
        but it blends more than the Super Eagle engine.
      HQ2X* [http://www.hiend3d.com/hq2x.html] (Win/SDL only) - Written by
        MaxSt. Applies an advanced algorithm to smooth the appearance of a
        low-resolution image. It is recommended to use a 2x scaled image with
        this filter.
      HQ3X* [http://www.hiend3d.com/hq3x.html] (Win only) - Written by MaxSt.
        More advanced than HQ2X, and it is recommended to use a 3x scaled image
        with this filter.
      HQ4X* [http://www.hiend3d.com/hq4x.html] (Win only) - Written by MaxSt.
        More advanced than HQ3X, and it is recommended to use a 4x scaled image
        with this filter.
      Note: The HQxX filters and the NTSC filter have particularly high
        system requirements to run smoothly.
  Scanlines: - Choose one Scanline mode. Requires a 'D' video mode.
      None - This will disable scanlines.
      25% - This will enable scanline mode, except that each line is 25% darker
        than the line above it.
      50% - This will enable scanline mode, except that each line is 50% darker
        than the line above it.
      Full - This mode adds a blank line in between every line to produce
        a scanline effect similar to a TV.
  Misc Filters: - Choose miscellaneous filters.
      Grayscale Mode - Makes the game display in monochrome color, i.e.
        black and white. This option is just there for fun and is probably not
        something you want to use continuously.
      Hi-Res Mode 7 - Requires a 'D' video mode and at least 512x448 resolution.
        Enabling this will double the vertical resolution used when rendering
        Mode 7 graphics. Thus, the resolution becomes 256*448 rather than the
        normal 256*224.
  Monitor Sync: - Select monitor synchronization options.
      VSync (Win/DOS only) - Synchronizes frame drawing to the monitor's
        refresh rate. This may reduce frame rate on your computer, but will
        reduce screen tearing.
      Triple Buffering (Win/DOS only) - This setting is only visible while
        using a fullscreen video mode, and only applies while in fullscreen.
        Whereas VSync has only two frame buffers: the frame being drawn and
        the frame waiting to draw, Triple Buffering can write frame data to
        a third buffer. The primary use is to reduce the impact of VSync on
        slower systems. This option has precedence over VSync in Fullscreen
        modes.
  Display Options: - Select how you want the image to be displayed.
      Use 4:3 Ratio (Win/SDL only) - This only applies when using a custom mode.
        Using this option will lock the video output at 4:3 aspect ratio,
        regardless of the aspect ratio of the custom resolution you've chosen.
      Small Screen (DOS only) - Video output will be at 256x224 (the native
        internal resolution of the SNES), instead of whatever resolution
        you are using.
      Full Screen / Wide Screen (DOS only) - Horizontally stretches video output
        to fill the screen.
  Not all of the video options above are available in every video mode
    and every port of ZSNES. Also note that you will need a fast computer
    for some of them if you don't want to see any slow-downs in emulation.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Configure various sound settings here.

  The default settings are those that are most accurate to a Super Nintendo.

  Sound Switches:
      Disable SPC Emulation - Disables the emulation of the SPC700 chip.
        Do not disable this unless you are having severe performance issues
        (i.e. ZSNES is unacceptably slow and you've tried everything else).
        Disabling this will likely result in sound errors.
      Enable Sound - Default: Checked. Unchecking this disables sound output.
        Do not disable this unless you are having severe performance issues
        (i.e. ZSNES is unacceptably slow and you've tried everything else).
        If you wish to mute ZSNES, just move the volume slider down to 0%.
      Enable Stereo Sound - Default: Checked. Unchecking this will disable
        *stereo* sound output; thus, sound output will be mono instead.
        Disabling this is a relatively safe way to improve speed, if necessary.
      Reverse Stereo Channels - Reverse/swap the left and right stereo channels.
        This makes no difference if stereo sound is disabled.
      Simulate Surround Sound - This is a novelty feature that simulates
        surround sound in games that don't have it natively. Do *not* use this
        in conjunction with games that have native surround sound. This option
        is only available when stereo sound is enabled.
      Force 8-bit Output (DOS only) - Force ZSNES to output sound in 8-bit mode.
        Using this may work around problems with certain sound cards, but will
        reduce sound quality. Note that if you use stereo sound in addition to
        this option, you will not be able to use sampling rates above 22050Hz.
      Use Primary Buffer (Win only) - Enable this only if your sound card is
        having problems designating the sound buffer with DirectSound. This will
        prevent sharing the sound card with other programs. This option is
        primarily useful for troubleshooting in Win9x. You must restart ZSNES
        for this feature to take effect.
  Sampling Rate: - Default: 32000Hz. Click inside the black box to cycle through
    all available sampling rates. Note that if you use sampling rates that are
    below the default, the sound will be distorted and inaccurate. Sampling
    rates higher than 32000Hz can also cause problems; however, sampling rates
    of 41000Hz and higher may resolve crackling issues that occur with some
    onboard sound cards.
  Volume Level - To change, just slide the bar. Sliding this to 0% is a better
    method of muting sound output than unchecking the Enable Sound box.
  Interpolation: - This feature smoothes out the wave forms of lower frequency
    sounds.
        None - Use no interpolation. This is *not* accurate to the SNES!
        Gaussian - Default. Based on the Gaussian curve, it smoothes the
          transition of the sound effects. This method of interpolation is used
          by a real SNES.
        Cubic Spline - This method is calculated by a cubic equation rather than
          being based on a curve like the Gaussian method. This results in
          better approximation than the Gaussian method.
        8-point* - Takes 8 points on the sound curve and smoothes them out.
  LowPass: - Low-pass filters accentuate bass frequencies by reducing higher
    frequencies. None of these filters are native to the SNES; if you want
    authentic SNES sound, do not use any of these. Using a filter will probably
    be most noticeable if you have a subwoofer.
        None - Use no low-pass filter.
        Simple - Allows lower frequencies to pass through (e.g. drums and
          the like). Certain higher ranges are not heard though.
        Dynamic - Allows greater range of frequencies to pass through;
          the music will seem more detailed depending on the loudness or
          softness of the audio.
        Hi Quality* - It's better than the simple filter, and seems to work well
          with lower quality speakers that have decent sound cards.
  *Requires MMX Support.

  Set and change paths used for save directories, graphics packs, and base
  cartridges.

  Saves: - Configure the directory where ZSNES will save and load SRAM, save
    state, and ZMV files. If you do not specify a path here, ZSNES Win and DOS
    will save all files to the same directory as the currently loaded ROM.
    ZSNES SDL will place them in "~/.zsnes". ZSNES SDL under Mac OS X will place
    them in "~/Library/Application Support/ZSNES".
  Snapshots: - Configure the directory to which in-game snapshots will be saved.
    If you do not specify a path here, snapshots will be saved to your Saves
    directory (above).
  SPCs: - Configure the directory to which SPC700 sound dumps (.spc; SNES
    music files) and sound buffer dumps will be saved. If you do not specify
    a path here, these files will be saved to your Saves directory (above).
  BIOS/Base Carts - Set the path to BIOS and base cartridges of various
    special games.
        BS-X: - Specify the full path and filename to the Broadcast Satellaview
          BIOS. Currently, the BIOS is *not* required to run BS games.
        Sufami Turbo - Specify the full path and filename to the Sufami Turbo
          BIOS, which is required to play ST games.
        Same Game: - Specify the full path and filename to the Same Game base
          cartridge ROM.
        SD Gundam G-Next - Specify the full path and filename to the SD Gundam
          G-Next base cartridge ROM.
  SPC7110 Graphic Packs - Enter the directories that contain SPC7110 graphic
    packs in the appropriate fields here. More information about this chip is
    in the Games page [Games.txt].
        FEOEZ: - Far East of Eden Zero

  Notes:
    * One limitation of ZSNES is that it only accepts one case of input.
      Since most UNIX-based systems are case-sensitive, SDL port users should
      edit their paths in the configuration file instead.
    * Paths can be absolute (e.g. C:\ZSNES\saves) or relative
      (e.g. ..\..\saves).
    * If you are using the Win port, you can paste text from the clipboard
      into the text boxes by using the key combination Ctrl+V.
    * Remember to always press Enter or Return after typing in your path,
      or it may not work!

  Configure various options regarding save states and in-game saves.

  # of Rewind States - This sets how many times you can rewind back.
    Note that you must restart your game for this feature to take effect.
  1/5 Seconds Per Rewind - This sets how many fifths of a second ZSNES will
    rewind back each time.
  Do Not Save SRAM - When enabled, SRAM will never be saved at any given point.
    This is useful when you want to look into savestates or movies without
    saving the modified data to disk. This also prevents SRAM Check+Save from
    working.
  SRAM Check+Save - Normally, ZSNES will write SRAM data to disk when you exit
    the emulator or exit to the GUI. When this option is enabled, ZSNES will
    instead write SRAM data shortly after a game modifies it. If you have
    problems with in-game saves not working correctly, or if you fear something
    may prevent ZSNES from exiting normally (i.e. crashing), turn this on.
    The reason this is not enabled by default is because some games use SRAM as
    working memory instead of for persistent saved games. Since these games
    constantly modify SRAM, ZSNES would write to the disk every few seconds
    (if this option is enabled).
  Load Save State w/ SRAM - When enabled, the SRAM data from the save states
    you load will overwrite any other SRAM data for the game that you have.
    Beware, though: if you are really far in a certain game, loading an old
    save state from a point earlier in the game will make you lose all of
    your progress beyond that save state. However, this option may be needed
    to load complete states in certain games.
  Start at Latest Save - With this enabled, every time you load a ROM, the
    save state slot containing the most recent save state for that game will
    be set as the currently selected slot.
  Auto Increment Save Slot - When enabled, the save slot will automatically
    move to the next slot after you save a state. This option is very useful
    in that it decreases the risk of accidentally saving over a previous
    save state, if you forget to manually advance the chosen slot.
  Auto State Save/Load - If this is enabled, ZSNES will automatically create a
    save state when you quit a game (either by loading another game or by
    exiting the emulator). When you return to the game at a later time, ZSNES
    will automatically load the save state it created before.
  Pause After... - Press the P key to unpause.
        Loading State - Pauses emulation after you load a save state.
        Pause After Rewind - Pauses emulation after you press the rewind key.
  State Shortcuts: - Click in a black box to assign a key to that function.
    Press ESC to clear the current assignment.
        ST0 through ST9 - Choose which save state slot to use.
        ST+ - Increment the selected save state slot by one.
        ST- - Decrement the selected save state slot by one.
        Save - Default: F2. Save a state to the current slot.
        Load - Default: F4. Load a state from the current slot.
        Pick - Default: F3. Open a dialog to choose the current save state slot.
          This will show a graphical preview of each save state. Learn more
          about how to use this dialog in the Save State Slot Chooser section
          at the bottom of the GUI page [GUI.txt].
        Rewind - With each use, this key will backtrack the gameplay
          incrementally, according to the options you have set for
          '# of Rewind States' and '1/5 Seconds Per Rewind' (see above).

  Change speed settings and frame skipping settings here.

  Max Frame Skip - Set the maximum number of frames that may be skipped
    in direct sequence when rendering, only as needed to keep a constant
    emulation speed. Applicable only when using Auto Frame Rate (below).
  Frame Rate - Set a static number of frames to skip rendering between each
    rendered frame, when *not* using Auto Frame Rate (below).
  FastFwd Ratio - Set the number by which the default emulation speed will be
    multiplied while using Fast Forward.
  SlowDwn Ratio - Set the number by which the default emulation speed will be
    divided while using Slow Down (e.g. "4" is 1/4 of normal speed).
  Shortcuts: - Assign keys to various speed options.
      Fast Forward - Default: ~ key. When used, the speed of emulation will
        increase (according to the FastFwd Ratio, above). Useful for quickly
        bypassing game intros or other sequences that you may not want to watch.
      Slow Down - When used, the speed of emulation will decrease (according to
        the SlowDwn Ratio, above). This function requires having Auto Frame Rate
        (below) enabled. You might use this to watch very fast animated
        sequences, or to give yourself an advantage when you need to react
        quickly to something in the game.
      + Emu Speed - Move the Emu Speed slider to the right by one step,
        increasing emulation speed sequentially (e.g. 1x -> 2x, 2x -> 3x, etc.).
      + Frame Rate - Increase the static number of frames to skip rendering.
        Using this key will disable Auto Frame Rate.
      Reset Speed - Sets the emulation speed back to normal (1x).
      - Emu Speed - Move the Emu Speed slider to the left by one step,
        decreasing emulation speed sequentially (e.g. 1x -> 1/2x, 1/2x -> 1/3x,
        etc.).
      - Frame Rate - Decrease the static number of frames to skip rendering.
        If you decrease it enough times, Auto Frame Rate will be enabled.
      Pause Game - Default: P key. Pauses emulation.
      Increment Frame - Only usable when emulation is paused, this feature will
        increment one frame each time the key is pressed.
  Toggled FFwd/SlwDwn - When unchecked, you must hold down the Fast Forward or
    Slow Down keys for as long as you want them to operate. When checked, press
    and release the assigned key once to enable the desired mode, and once again
    to turn it off.
  Auto Frame Rate - Default: Checked. When enabled, ZSNES will attempt to
    maintain emulation at full speed. If necessary to maintain full-speed
    emulation, ZSNES will skip rendering frames of video. When disabled, ZSNES
    will skip a static number of frames for each rendered frame. If your
    priority is full-speed emulation, you should have this enabled, and increase
    Max Frame Skip (above) to its maximum. If your priority is to have every
    frame of video rendered, you should either have this enabled and set Max
    Frame Skip to zero OR disable this and set Frame Rate (above) to zero.
  Emu Speed: - Default: 1x. Only available when using Auto Frame Rate. This
    slider sets the number by which normal emulation speed will be multiplied or
    divided (to speed up or slow down emulation speed, respectively).

Read the Cheat Codes section in the Readme [Readme.txt] for general information.

Nach, the creator of NSRT, has a complete list of all official Game Genie codes,
available at [http://nsrt.edgeemu.com/forum/kb.php?mode=article&k=3].

  Selecting Add Code from the Cheat menu opens this dialog with the cursor in
  the Enter Code: text box. Selecting Browse from the Cheat menu starts with
  the cheat list highlighted.

  Use this dialog to add, remove, and browse cheat codes.

  Cheat Browser - This lists all cheats that you have added for the currently
    loaded game. You can have up to 255 codes per game. Each cheat is
    represented on a single row (except in the case of multi-line cheats).
    Each column gives different information about the cheat, as follows:
      Address - Memory address that the cheat edits.
      CV - Current value of the selected memory address.
      PV - Previous value of the selected memory address.
      Tgl - Shows whether the cheat is toggled (active) or not.
      Description - The description for the cheat that you typed into
        the Description: box when adding the cheat.
  Buttons
      Remove - Remove the currently highlighted cheat.
      Toggle - Toggle on or off the currently highlighted cheat. This can also
        be accomplished by double-clicking on a code.
      Save - Save all cheats in the list to a .cht file.
      Load - If a .cht file exists in your saves directory, this will load all
        cheats from that file into the Cheat Browser.
      Fix - If you have entered a cheat and it doesn't appear to work, you can
        try using this button to change the memory address that the cheat edits,
        which might fix the problem.
  Enter Code: - Type in the cheat code. Game Genie, Pro Action Replay, and
    GoldFinger codes are supported. Remember that Game Genie codes require
    the - (dash).
  Description: - Type in a description for your code.
  Add button - Add the code to the Cheat Browser once you have filled in the
    previous two boxes.
  Auto-load .cht file at game load - When you load a ROM, ZSNES will look in
    your saves directory for a matching .cht file, and load it. This prevents
    you from having to hit the Load button, above.

  Notes on usage:
    * To use a multi-line cheat code, just enter each line as a separate code!
    * You can also quickly modify the value of the currently selected cheat code
      (in the browse window) by typing a 2 digit hex number in the cheat code
      enter space.
    * You can allow a value of one cheat code to be mirrored from a value of
      another cheat code. To do this, type an 'R' at the end of any cheat code
      as the destination, then type another cheat code (Without the 'R') as the
      source. For example, if you want address 7E1000 to reflect the value at
      address 7F2000 (whatever value written to 7F2000 from the game will also
      be written to 7E1000), enter cheat code 7E1000FFR, then cheat code
      7F2000FF (where FF can be any value).

  Keyboard usage:
    * Use the Up and Down arrows to scroll through the Cheat Browser.
    * Use the R, T, S, L, and F keys to duplicate the functions of the five
      buttons below the Cheat Browser.
    * Use Tab to move from the Enter Code: box to the Description: box.

  Selecting Seach from the Cheat menu opens the Cheat Search dialog. Use this
  to search for values in memory such as life, score, etc. and change their
  values as you please.

  Setup Search
 - - - - - - - -

  Select Size and Format:
      Size: You can choose the data size to use in your search. If you know the
        numerical values of the data you want to view, select the smallest
        number range that fits the data values. (For example, if you know the
        value cannot go higher than 50000, select 2 BYTES [0..65535] instead of
        3 BYTES [0..16777215]). Sometimes you don't know the numerical value (in
        the case of life bars), so you have to guess the size.
            1 Byte [0..255] - Value is stored in 8 bits.
            2 Bytes [0..65535] - Value is stored in 16 bits.
            3 Bytes [0..16777215] - Value is stored in 24 bits.
            4 Bytes [0..4294967295] - Value is stored in 32 bits.
      Format: In general, it's recommended that you use decimal, although there
        are some cases that have the values in memory stored as binary-coded
        decimal. For example, "34 lives" could be stored in a byte as 34h, and
        if you were searching for it in the decimal mode, it would actually have
        a value of 52.
            Dec (Base 10) - The number you search for will be treated as a
              decimal number.
            Hex (Base 16) - The number you search for will be treated as a
              hexadecimal number.
  Select Search Type:
      Exact Value Search - In this mode, you have to enter the exact numerical
        value that you want to find. If you have 3 lives left, then search for
        the value 3. The cheat search engine also looks for "value - 1" since
        even if a game tells you that you have 3 lives left, it usually stores
        the value as 2 in memory.
      Comparative Search - In this mode, you select whether the value is less
        than, greater than, equal to, or not equal to the previous value. So if
        you have a life bar and the life bar suddenly decreases, go back to the
        cheat search engine and select "less than" to search for any value that
        has decreased.
  Start button - Move to the next step of the search, entering a value.

  5.          Netplay Menu (Win and SDL Only)
............................................................

Netplay has been disabled for the indefinite future, until the core becomes more
accurate and/or non-random. We recommend using ZSNES v1.36 or v1.42n
[http://nsrt.edgeemu.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=448] until this is resolved.

The Netplay dialog is only accessible if a game is loaded.

 .             Internet              .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Port - Default: 7845. This is the port on which ZSNES will communicate. While
    the number can range from 0 to 65535, it is recommended that you stay above
    5000 to avoid conflicts with other services.
  Nickname - This is the name you will use, displayed in the Chat window (which
    appears once you connect).
  Start as Server - Use this button to be the host of the Netplay game. Your
    opponent will connect to you and be the client.
  Client Options: - Setup options here if you are going to be the client, not
    the host.
        IP: - Enter the IP ("Internet Protocol") address of the host.
        Connect to Server - Use this button to attempt to connect to the
          above-entered IP address.
  Your IP: - Helpfully displays your current IP address. If you are going to be
    the host, give your opponents this number so they can connect to you.
  Use UDP instead of TCP - Decide which protocol to use for communication.
    TCP ("Transmission Control Protocol") guarantees delivery of packets,
    but has more overhead, and may thus be slower than UDP ("User Datagram
    Protocol"). Try switching between the two to see which works best.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Establishing a Connection (Chat Window)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Window - This is quite obvious. You and your partner chat to each other
    through this window. Simply type your message and press Return/Enter on your
    keyboard, just like on an IRC or IM client.
  Player Select - This indicates which players will be hosted locally and which
    will be hosted remotely. A checked box means that your computer will have
    control of that player. An 'X'ed box means the remote computer will have
    control of that player. A blank box means that player is not enabled.
  Latency - Default: 3. ??????????????????
  Back Buffer - Default: Enabled. ??????????????????
  Save Data - Determine whether the SRAM from your computer (local) or the other
    computer (remote) should be used. You can also choose to not load any SRAM
    at all.
  Disconnect - Closes the connection and ends the netplay session.

  Here you can change various function keys that are not configured elsewhere.
  Clicking inside a black box will bring a box, prompting you to assign a key
  to that function. Press the key you wish to assign, or press ESC to clear
  the existing assignment.

  BG Disables:
      BG1 through BG4 - Toggle the various graphical background layers
        on or off. Normally, they should be left on.
      OBJ - Toggle the sprite/background layer on or off.
  Sound Keys:
      Ch1 through Ch8 - Toggle the various sound channels on or off.
      +Vol - Increase the volume.
      -Vol - Decrease the volume.
  Quick Keys:
      Load - Opens the Load dialog (accessed from the Game menu).
      Reset - Performs a soft reset of the game. Also available under
        Game->Reset.
      Exit - Exits ZSNES.
      Clock - Toggle the clock, displaying system time on-screen during
        gameplay.
      Chat - This is available only while using Netplay. After pressing
        this key, type your message, then press Enter/Return to send it to
        the other user.
      Snapshot - Save a snapshot of the game screen and place it in your
        Snapshots directory. Also accessible through the F1 Menu.
      Save SPC - Save SPC data to your SPCs directory. Also accessible through
        the F1 Menu.
  Misc Toggles:
      Use PL12/34 - Toggles on or off the Use Pl3/4 as Pl1/2 option under
        Config->Options.
      Panic Key - Restores default settings for several toggles. Enables
        Offset Mode, Windowing, and all Backgrounds, Sprites, and Sound
        Channels; disables Add-ons; resets Emu Speed throttle.
      Display FPS - Toggles on or off the Frames per Second counter. Also
        accessible through the F1 Menu. You can also make this a persistent
        option under Config->Options.
      Battery Power (Win/SDL only) - Displays the amount of battery life
        remaining and, if possible, time remaining, as reported by your
        operating system. This feature is intended for laptop or notebook PCs.
  GFX Toggles:
      New GFX Engine - Switches between the faster, newer graphics engine
        (default) and an older one. The new one is recommended, but using
        the older one may fix graphics corruption in some games.
      BG Window - A graphical feature that toggles windowing effects in
        certain SNES games.
      Offset Mode - A graphical feature that toggles using offsets for tiles
        in certain SNES games.
      + Gamma - Increase gamma level. This makes the video appear brighter.
      - Gamma - Decrease gamma level. This makes the video appear darker.

 .        GUI Opts (Options)         .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Configure various GUI settings not set elsewhere (like Config->Options).

  GUI Switches:
      RClick Opens GUI - When enabled, clicking the right mouse button will
        switch to and from the GUI when running a game (similar to pressing
        ESC). However, this can slow down emulation, since ZSNES has to check
        the mouse button status once in a while. If you are running in a
        windowed video mode, the right-click button won't return back to
        the game.
      Swap L/R MButtons - Enabling this will swap the functions of buttons 0
        and 1 of your mouse.
      Show Mouse Shadow - Disables/Enables the mouse shadow.
      Mice Wrap GUI Win - Allows the mouse pointer to wrap (to the other side of
        the screen) at the borders of the screen. You should probably only
        enable this while in Fullscreen; in Windowed mode this behavior
        can be annoying.
      Trap Mouse Cursor (Win only) - Prevents the mouse cursor from exiting the
        ZSNES GUI. You will have to move the mouse with extra speed to make the
        cursor exit the GUI with this feature enabled.
      Wheel Mice Scroll (Win only) - This feature allows you to use your mouse
        wheel to quickly scroll through various lists in the GUI (e.g. game list
        in load menu, video modes, etc.). In the SDL port, the Wheel should
        always be enabled.
      ESC to Game Menu - While running a game, pressing Esc will take you back
        to the GUI with the Game Menu open, regardless of which menu was open
        last. It will also make the Game Menu be already open when you start
        ZSNES. If this is unchecked, you will have difficulty navigating the GUI
        without a mouse.
      Ctrl GUI w/GPad1 - When enabled, it allows you to use the device
        configured for SNES Controller #1 to access the GUI. This way you can
        use your gamepad or joystick instead of your mouse/keyboard. The
        equivalent SNES keys to the keyboard keys are:
            SNES D-Pad = Move mouse cursor
            SNES A = Enter
            SNES B = Esc
            SNES L = PageUp
            SNES R = PageDown
      Filtered GUI - Any video filter settings will be applied to the GUI, in
        addition to the game video output.
      Use Custom Font - When checked, ZSNES will load font data from zfont.txt.
      Save GUI Win Pos - When enabled, the GUI doesn't reset the locations of
        the windows when you exit/enter the GUI.
  BG Effects: - Only one of the following screen saver-like effects can be
    enabled at a time. They are visible in the background while the GUI is open.
      * None - no effect is active.
      * Snow - Looks like falling snow.
      * Burning - Looks like fire rising from the bottom of the window.
      * Smoke -  Looks like smoke rising from the bottom of the window.
      * Water A - Looks like a water strider skimming across water.
      * Water B - Looks like rain drops falling on water and creating ripples.
  Color: - This section allows you to customize the colors used by the GUI.
      Choose which part of the GUI to configure by selecting one of the
        following:
          * Back - Configure the color of the background of the GUI.
              Defaults: R=10; G=15; B=31.
          * Title - Configre color of the GUI's title bar.
              Defaults: R=0; G=10; B=31.
          * Win - Configure the background color of a dialog window. Dialog
              title bar colors are not configurable. Defaults: R=8; G=8; B=25.
      Use the sliders to change the relative quantities of Red, Green, and Blue
        color for the part of the GUI you have chosen to configure.
  Main Windows Options:
      Emu Always on Top (Win only) - ZSNES will stay visible above other
        windows, even if it loses focus. Minimize ZSNES if you need to access
        other windows.
      Save Main Window Position (Win only) - Saves the location of the ZSNES
        window between sessions.
      Allow Multiple Instances of Emu (Win only) - Allows you to open more than
        one instance of ZSNES at a time. In the SDL port, multiple instances are
        always allowed.

 .        Movie Opt (Options)        .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  The Movie Options dialog is only accessible if a game is loaded.

  You can record your gameplay so that you can play it back at a later date
  either to amuse your friends, torture your friends, or whatever. Also be
  sure to check out the Movies section of the Readme [Readme.txt], where
  you can find more information on subtitles, re-recording, and more.

  Warning: Playing back a previously recorded movie will overwrite any SRAM data
    for the current game with the SRAM data contained in the ZMV file. This
    means you should back up your SRAM files when playing around with movies!!

  Select Movie: - Choose the movie recording slot to be used for
    recording/playback. The number of the slot corresponds to the ZMV extension
    (0 corresponding to .zmv, 1 to .zm1, ... 9 to .zm9).
  Status: - Simply tells you if a record/playback is currently in progress.

  Record From:
      Now - Begins recording the movie from the current point in the game.
      Power - This will perform a hard reset (equivalent to shutting off the
        SNES, then turning it back on again), then begin recording.
      Reset - This will perform a soft reset (equivalent to using the Reset
        button on the SNES), then begin recording.
      Power+SRAM Clear - Performs a hard reset, then clears SRAM data
        (in-game save data). Useful if, for example, you don't want to see
        your saved games in the game menu when making your movie.
  Main controls:
      Play - Begins playing the movie that is recorded in the current slot.
      Record - Begins recording a movie to the current slot. While in playback
        mode, you can use this to start recording and redo the remainder of the
        movie.
      Stop - Stops playing or recording a movie.
      Append - This is usable only if you already have an existing ZMV using the
        new ZMV format. It allows you to continue recording a movie from the
        point where it is stopped. Press this button only when the movie status
        is inactive.
  Chapters: - You can assign a key to each of these functions by clicking in
    the black box next to each button and pressing a key.
      Insert - During recording or playback, this can create a point (chapter)
        to which you can seek during playback.
      Previous - Only usable during playback, this "rewinds" the movie to a
        previous chapter earlier in the movie.
      Next - Only usable during playback, this "fast forwards" the movie to a
        chapter that is found at a later point in the movie.
      There is currently no method for deleting a chapter.
  On Movie State Load: - Allow mode status to be changed when you are loading a
    movie state.
      Do Not Switch Modes - Don't change the current mode.
      Switch to Record - Set the current mode to Record on load.
      Switch to Playback - Set the current mode to Playback on load.
  Display Frame Counter - Enable this to see the frame counter in the
    bottom-left corner of the screen during playback/recording. This is useful
    for determining where you can insert movie subtitles and for deciding where
    you want to end a movie when dumping it with the Dump # of Frames option.

  Dumping tab

  Video/Audio Dumping is recommended only for advanced users. More information
  is found in the Movie Dumping section of the Advanced Usage page
  [Advanced.txt].

  Video Options: - You can only choose one of the following.
      No Video Dump - Use this option when you want only audio.
      Raw Video (No compression) - Dump raw 24 bit BGR video. This produces a
        file that no typical media player can read. Only use this option if you
        plan on manually encoding it. On UNIX systems, you can use a FIFO file
        to encode this in real-time, as an alternative to ZSNES's internal use
        of MEncoder. Caution: Raw movies require a tremendous amount of disk
        space, so make sure you have plenty of room before you begin!
      FFV1 (Some compression) - Dump in an AVI container using FFMPEG's lossless
        video codec. The size of this file will be about 8% of the size of the
        raw video file.
      x264 Lossless (Most compression) - Dump in an AVI container using the very
        advanced x264 codec in practically lossless mode (slow). The size of
        this file will be about 38% of the size of an XviD file, about 6% of the
        size of an FFV1 file, and about 0.5% of the size of a raw video file.
      XviD Lossless (More compression) - Dump in an AVI container using the
        popular XviD codec in practically lossless mode (fast). The size of this
        file will be about 15% of the size of an FFV1 file, and about 1% of the
        size of a raw video file.
      Custom - Uses alternative, user-defined parameters from the zmovie.cfg
        file. This option allows the use of multi-pass movie dumping to
        massively reduce the size of the outputted video file. Caution: This
        mode dumps lossy video; however, the default settings should look good
        for most games.
  Audio Options: - You can choose any combination of the following.
      Dump Audio - Enable audio dumping.
      Compress Audio - Audio output will be compressed to MP3 as it is dumped.
        We recommend that you use this setting. When unchecked, audio output
        will be in WAV format.
      Merge With Video - Place the outputted audio in the AVI along with the
        video.
  Dumping Length: - Choose the length of the video/audio file(s) to be created.
      ZMV Length - Simply dump the entire movie.
      Dump # of Frames - This sets the exact number of frames of the movie to
        dump, according to what you have typed in the black box at the right.
      Until Stop - Keep recording until you stop dumping. This is primarily used
        for recording a movie even after the ZMV has completed playback. You may
        want to dump the ending of a game, which TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedruns)
        reach but often don't capture in the ZMV.
  Dumping:
      Start - Start dumping the movie in the selected slot, using the current
        settings.
      Stop - Use this to stop dumping a movie before the process has finished.

  Saving or loading a state during recording will allow you to undo mistakes,
  i.e. re-record, while making a movie. These states created during record
  can also be loaded during playback, like chapters. However, unlike chapters,
  you're limited to 100 of them.

  Loading another game will halt the play/record process.

  Movie dumping options can be tweaked by advanced users in the zmovie.cfg file
  [Advanced.txt].

  Key Comb. (Key Combination Editor) .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Allows you to specify certain keyboard combination routines with a single
  keystroke/joystick button press.

  List of combinations
  Clear - Clears the current key combination field.
  Add - Adds the key combination fields below as a new entry.
  Replace - Copies the contents of the key combination fields below to the
    current highlighted key combination above.
  Delete - Deletes the highlighted key combination above.
  Key - Clicking on this box will allow you to select which key/button to use.
  Description - Allows you type in the description of the combination key.
  P# - Selects which player # will use those keys.
  > = Last </> - Enabling this would mean that the event symbol > will mean the
    last left or right direction the user presses in the game and the symbol <
    is the opposite of that direction. When disabled, > means right and < means
    left.
  Game Specific - Enabling this will tell ZSNES to use separate key combination
    files for each individual game.
  Combination Keys - This window will display the sequence of events selected by
    the user.
  Events:
      Press+Rel - The key will be pressed and held. It will be released once
        another key is pressed after any amount of frame or second delay.
      Press Only - The key will be pressed and held.
      Rel Only - The key will be released if it is pressed by a press only
        event.
      Frame Delay - Delays for the specified number of frames.
      Second Delay - Delays for the specified number of seconds.
      Del - Deletes the event at the end of the combination keys list if one
        exists.

  Note: A 1 frame delay exists after the combination key list has finished
    processing.

  Example Key Combination: (Down / Down+Right / Right / L):
    Method 1: Press+Rel Down / 2 Frame Delay / Press+Rel Down / Press+Rel Right
        / 2 Frame Delay / Press+Rel Right / 2 Frame Delay / Press+Rel L
    Method 2: Press Only Down / 2 Frame Delay / Press Only Right / 2 Frame Delay
        / Rel Only Down / 2 Frame Delay / Rel Only Right / Press Only L

  7.                      F1 Menu
............................................................

Use this menu to access oft-used functions. Most of these are related to dumping
data from the game you are running.

  Save Snapshot - Creates an image of the game screen in your Snapshots
    directory.
  Show/Hide FPS - Shows or hides the frames-per-second display which appears
    on the bottom-left corner of the screen. The value shown on the right side
    of the display is the rate that the SNES should be maintaining. This
    counter is available only when in auto frame rate mode. You can have
    this display enabled by default under Config->Options.
  Save SPC Data - Using this will search for the beginning of the next song and
    save the data into an SPC file. To capture a song, it is best/recommended to
    initiate this feature approximately 2 seconds before the next song starts.
    This does have potential to fail though, so don't expect it to work all the
    time. The .spc file will be placed in your SPCs directory.
  Sound Buffer Dump - This dumps ZSNES' sound buffer and also filters out any
    unoccupied space. The sound buffer contains decompressed samples which are
    written to when ZSNES plays/decodes a sample from sound memory. Because of
    the way ZSNES buffers the sound data, this can produce inaccurate results.
    The dump will be placed in your SPCs directory.
  Snapshot/Incr Frame - Same as snapshot, but it returns to the F1 menu after
    a couple of frames. Useful for making animations.
  Incr Frame Only - Move forward one frame without taking a snapshot.
  Move This Window - Moves the F1 menu to a different location.
  Image Format: - Choose what image format to use for snapshots of the game
    screen. This setting is also configurable under Config->Options.
      * BMP - Snapshots will be saved as bitmap pictures (16-bit color). If you
          are using an 8-bit video mode in the DOS port, the bitmap will be
          saved with 8-bit color.
      * PNG - Snapshots will be saved as PNG ("Portable Network Graphics") files
          (32-bit ARGB color). This is not selectable while using an 8-bit mode
          or if you did not compile with PNG support.

  8.              Save State Slot Chooser
............................................................

Use this dialog to pick which save state slot to use. A graphical preview of the
save state will be shown above this dialog (it is not visible in the above
picture).

How to Use:
    1. Press F3 to open this dialog.
    2. Use Up/Down arrow keys to move between save state levels.
    3. Use Left/Right arrow keys to move between save states on a certain level.
    4. Use Enter or Return or ESC to use the selected save slot.
    5. Use either F2 to save a state or F4 to load a state in the slot you just
       selected.

Color Key:
    * Slots with blue backgrounds do not have a save state in them.
    * Slots with red backgrounds have a save state in them.
    * The slot with the orange background contains the most recent save state
      within that state level.
